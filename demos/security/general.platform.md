# Security Remediation with Devin — Desktop + Cloud Demo

**Other variants:** [Cloud only](general.md) | [CLI variant](general.local.md)

Devin operates as a background security agent — scanning, triaging, fixing,
and re-scanning in a closed loop. This variant runs from Devin Desktop:
delegate scan-fix tasks to Cloud, monitor remediation sessions in the Agent
Command Center, and review security fix PRs with one-click checkout in your
editor.

## The Pattern

The universal closed-loop approach for event-driven security remediation:

```
Scanner detects vulnerabilities
        ↓
CI workflow / webhook triggers Devin via v3 API
        ↓
Devin triages findings, applies fixes per service/language
        ↓
Push triggers re-scan — closed loop
        ↓
Escalation: after N attempts, open an issue for human review
```

### Step by step

1. **Scanner detects vulnerabilities** — dependency CVEs, code quality
   issues, SAST findings, license violations. The scanner runs as part of
   CI or on a schedule.

2. **CI workflow or webhook triggers Devin** — a GitHub Actions job calls
   the Devin v3 API with the scan results and a remediation prompt. The
   Cloud session runs on its own VM.

3. **Devin triages findings, applies fixes** — Devin reads the scan output,
   identifies the correct manifest files, upgrades vulnerable dependencies
   or fixes code-level issues, and runs the affected service tests.

4. **Push triggers re-scan** — the fix commit triggers the same CI pipeline.
   If findings are resolved, CI goes green.

5. **Escalation policy** — after a configurable number of attempts, the
   workflow opens a GitHub Issue for human review.

### Bot-loop prevention

- **Author check** — skip PRs authored by `devin-ai-integration[bot]`
- **Attempt counter** — stop after `MAX_FIX_ATTEMPTS`
- **Concurrency groups** — prevent duplicate sessions
- **One-time remediation** — comment-based check for `check_run` scanners

## Running It Live from Desktop

### Delegate the pipeline setup to Cloud

Open Devin Desktop and create a new session. Paste the prompt below, then
delegate to Cloud — the Cloud agent runs on its own VM while you continue
working locally.

```
Create a GitHub Actions workflow called
sast-auto-remediate.yml on the <repo-name> repo that:

1. Triggers on pull_request events (opened, synchronize)
   for branches other than those authored by
   devin-ai-integration[bot].

2. Runs a security scan using <scanner-name> targeting
   HIGH and CRITICAL severity findings.

3. Parses the scan output and posts a PR comment
   summarizing findings by service/directory.

4. If findings exist and fewer than 2 fix attempts have
   been made, calls the Devin v3 API to create a
   remediation session on the same branch.

5. If findings persist after 2 attempts, opens a GitHub
   Issue labeled "security" and "needs-human-review".

Include bot-loop prevention (author check + attempt
counter) and concurrency groups.
```

### Monitor in the Agent Command Center

Once the Cloud session is running, open the Agent Command Center (Kanban
view) in Desktop. The session card shows:

- **Status** — in progress, waiting for review, or completed
- **PR link** — click to open the PR directly in your editor
- **Session timeline** — every scan result and fix attempt

Use the Kanban to track multiple remediation sessions across repos. Group
related sessions using **Spaces** — for example, a "Security Sprint" Space
that collects all active remediation work.

### Review security fix PRs in your editor

When Devin opens a PR, Desktop shows a notification. Use **one-click
checkout** to pull the branch into your editor and review the changes
locally:

1. Click the PR notification in Desktop
2. Desktop checks out the branch in your editor
3. Review the diff — Devin's changes are scoped to the affected manifests
   and source files
4. Run tests locally if needed, then approve and merge

### Burn down an existing backlog from Desktop

Create a session in Desktop with this prompt, then delegate to Cloud:

```
Review the security scan results for <repo-name>.
Triage all HIGH and CRITICAL findings by severity.
For each finding:

1. Identify the affected file and the fix.
2. Check out a branch from main.
3. Apply the fix in the correct manifest/source file.
4. Run the affected service's tests.
5. Push the fix.

Group related fixes per service into single PRs.
Skip findings in test files.
```

Monitor progress in the Agent Command Center as PRs appear.

## Scaling with Child Sessions

For enterprise-scale remediation, delegate the parent session from Desktop
to Cloud. The parent triages findings and spawns one child session per
service.

```
You are coordinating a security remediation across the
<repo-name> repository.

Run the security scan and capture the output. Create a
SECURITY_BACKLOG.md listing all CRITICAL and HIGH
findings organized by service or directory.

Then launch parallel child sessions — one per affected
service — with scoped instructions:
- Each child works only on its assigned service directory
- Each child upgrades the vulnerable dependency, runs
  the service tests, and pushes to the same branch
- After all children complete, summarize results in
  REMEDIATION_SUMMARY.md
```

The Agent Command Center shows the parent session and all child sessions
as separate cards. Use Spaces to group them into a single view for tracking.

## The Verification Loop

1. **Same CI that found the problem re-scans after Devin's fix** — no manual
   verification step for dependency upgrades or well-documented fixes.

2. **Converging loop** — each iteration reduces the finding count. When
   findings reach zero, CI goes green.

3. **Bounded iterations** — the attempt counter ensures the loop terminates.
   After the configured maximum, the workflow escalates to humans.

4. **Desktop visibility** — the Agent Command Center shows the status of
   every remediation session. Failed sessions surface immediately; you can
   review the escalation issue directly in your editor.

5. **Audit trail** — every scan result, Devin session link, and escalation
   issue is recorded in the PR timeline.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Desktop as your security command center** — delegate remediation to
   Cloud, monitor progress in the Agent Command Center, and review fix PRs
   with one-click checkout in your editor.

2. **Scanner-agnostic architecture** — the pattern works with any scanner.
   Swap the scan step; the Devin API integration stays the same.

3. **Spaces for organization** — group related remediation sessions into
   Spaces for a unified view of your security sprint.

4. **Closed-loop verification** — CI re-scans after every fix. No manual
   verification step.

5. **Guardrails built in** — bot-loop prevention, concurrency groups,
   attempt counters, and human escalation.

6. **Team-based operation** — pipelines, knowledge, and playbooks are
   shared across the organization. Desktop gives every team member
   visibility into the remediation pipeline.
