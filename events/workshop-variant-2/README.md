# Workshop Variant 2: Quality Engineering & Security Vulnerability Remediation

## Event Details

| | |
|---|---|
| **Variant Name** | Workshop Variant 2 |
| **Focus** | Quality engineering (first half) + security vulnerability remediation (second half) |
| **Duration** | ~3 hours (flexible: 90 min per half + breaks) |
| **Facilitator** | Brian Smitches, brian.smitches@cognition.ai |
| **Event Site** | https://partner-workshops.devinenterprise.com |
| **Audience** | QA/QE engineers, AppSec/DevSecOps practitioners, engineering leads responsible for test coverage or security compliance |

## Abstract

> Join us for a hands-on workshop exploring how AI-powered software engineering accelerates two critical disciplines: quality engineering and security vulnerability remediation.
>
> **First half — Quality Engineering:** Participants will use Devin to add linting rules, generate unit tests, build E2E test suites, and produce documentation — turning under-tested codebases into well-covered, maintainable projects.
>
> **Second half — Security Vulnerability Remediation:** Participants will run local SAST tools (OWASP Dependency-Check, SonarQube Community Edition) to identify dependency CVEs and code-level vulnerabilities, then use Devin to remediate findings, upgrade vulnerable dependencies, and add shift-left CI gating.
>
> **Who should attend:** QA/QE engineers, AppSec and DevSecOps practitioners, engineering leads responsible for test coverage or security compliance, and anyone curious about applying AI assistants to quality and security workflows.

## Structure

Two halves, each with 2 structured labs:

1. **First Half — Quality Engineering (~90 min):** Labs 1 and 2 cover linting, unit testing, E2E testing, and documentation
2. **Break (15 min)**
3. **Second Half — Security Vulnerability Remediation (~90 min):** Labs 3 and 4 cover SAST scanning, CVE remediation, dependency upgrades, and shift-left CI

## Featured Labs

### Lab 1 — Linting & Unit Testing (45 min)
- **Modules:** [QE1 — Linting](../../modules/quality-engineering/QE1.md) + [QE2 — Unit Testing](../../modules/quality-engineering/QE2.md)
- **Repository:** [app_timesheet](https://github.com/Cognition-Partner-Workshops/app_timesheet)
- **Objective:** Start by resolving linting issues (GitHub Issue #3), then improve unit test coverage and generate a coverage report
- **Target Outcomes:**
  - All ESLint/Prettier violations resolved
  - Unit test coverage increased (target: 80%+)
  - Coverage report generated
  - PR with linting fixes and new tests

### Lab 2 — E2E Testing & Documentation (45 min)
- **Modules:** [QE3 — End-to-End Testing](../../modules/quality-engineering/QE3.md) + [QE4 — Inline Documentation](../../modules/quality-engineering/QE4.md)
- **Repository:** [app_timesheet](https://github.com/Cognition-Partner-Workshops/app_timesheet)
- **Alternative E2E repo:** [cal.com](https://github.com/Cognition-Partner-Workshops/cal.com) (for participants wanting a more complex target)
- **Objective:** Write and run E2E tests against the locally running application, then improve inline documentation across the codebase
- **Target Outcomes:**
  - E2E test suite created (Playwright or Selenium)
  - Devin screen recording of test execution as evidence
  - JSDoc/inline documentation added to key modules
  - PR with tests and documentation

### Lab 3 — CVE Remediation with Local SAST Tools (60 min)
- **Modules:** [SEC1 — Upgrade Dependencies](../../modules/security/SEC1.md) + [SEC2 — Remediate Vulnerabilities](../../modules/security/SEC2.md)
- **Repository:** [uc-cve-remediation-regulatory-compliance](https://github.com/Cognition-Partner-Workshops/uc-cve-remediation-regulatory-compliance)
- **Objective:** Use pre-configured local SAST tools to scan for vulnerabilities, remediate the most critical findings, and upgrade outdated dependencies
- **Target Outcomes:**
  - OWASP Dependency-Check report generated (before and after remediation)
  - SonarQube analysis completed with security hotspots reviewed
  - High/critical vulnerabilities patched or upgraded (Spring Boot 2.6.3 upgraded)
  - `SECURITY_REMEDIATION.md` with before/after evidence
  - PR with all remediations documented

#### Pre-configured SAST Tools (both local — no cloud costs)

| Tool | What It Scans | Command |
|------|--------------|---------|
| [OWASP Dependency-Check](https://owasp.org/www-project-dependency-check/) | Dependencies against the NVD for known CVEs | `./gradlew dependencyCheckAnalyze` |
| [SonarQube Community Edition](https://www.sonarsource.com/open-source-editions/sonarqube-community-edition/) | Source code for vulnerabilities, code smells, bugs | `docker compose -f docker-compose.sonarqube.yml up -d` then `./gradlew sonar` |

### Lab 4 — Shift Left & Security Antipatterns (45 min)
- **Modules:** [SEC3 — Shift Left](../../modules/security/SEC3.md) + [SEC4 — Identify Antipatterns](../../modules/security/SEC4.md)
- **Repository:** [uc-cve-remediation-regulatory-compliance](https://github.com/Cognition-Partner-Workshops/uc-cve-remediation-regulatory-compliance) or [app_timesheet](https://github.com/Cognition-Partner-Workshops/app_timesheet)
- **Objective:** Add CI workflows that gate on security policy violations, then identify and fix security antipatterns in application code
- **Target Outcomes:**
  - GitHub Actions workflow added with security scanning (Trivy, OWASP DC, or SonarQube)
  - CI fails on HIGH/CRITICAL findings
  - SBOM generated (CycloneDX or SPDX)
  - Security antipatterns identified (OWASP Top 10 review)
  - PR with CI workflow and antipattern fixes

## Repos Required on Devin's Machine

- [ ] app_timesheet
- [ ] uc-cve-remediation-regulatory-compliance
- [ ] cal.com (optional, for Lab 2 alternative)

## Runtime Resources

- **app_timesheet:** Backend on port 3001, frontend on port 5173 (needed for Lab 2 E2E testing)
- **SonarQube:** `docker compose -f docker-compose.sonarqube.yml up -d` on port 9000 (needed for Lab 3)

If hosted instances are available, refer to [runtime-resources.md](../../shared/runtime-resources.md) for URLs and credentials.

## Repo Duplication Notes

- `uc-cve-remediation-regulatory-compliance` originates from `spring-boot-realworld-example-app` (Cluster C1 in [catalog](../../catalog/repos.md)). It is an isolated copy for security exercises — participants can safely modify it without affecting other labs.
- `app_timesheet` (renamed from `client-timesheet-app`) is a standalone repo used across QE and security challenges.

## Context

- **Audience:** QA/QE engineers, AppSec/DevSecOps practitioners, engineering leads
- **Flow:** The workshop progresses from quality foundations (linting, testing) to security remediation (SAST, CVE patching, shift-left CI) — showing how quality and security practices reinforce each other
- **Key narrative:** Devin handles the tedious work (running scanners, interpreting reports, generating tests) so engineers can focus on evaluating and verifying results
- **SAST tools are local:** All security scanning runs on the participant's machine via Gradle plugins and Docker — no cloud accounts or paid licenses required
