# Platform-Conformant Microservice Decomposition — Hands-on Lab

## Event Details

| | |
|---|---|
| **Variant Name** | Platform-Conformant Microservice Decomposition |
| **Focus** | Monolith-to-microservices decomposition with IaC conformance on Kubernetes |
| **Duration** | ~90 minutes (75 min lab + 15 min review/discussion) |
| **Facilitator** | Brian Smitches, brian.smitches@cognition.ai |
| **Event Site** | https://partner-workshops.devinenterprise.com |
| **Audience** | DevOps / Platform Engineering / Solution Architects |

## Abstract

> In this hands-on lab, participants use Devin to decompose a bounded context from a .NET 8 + Angular 17 monolith into a standalone microservice that conforms to an existing platform engineering standard deployed on Kubernetes.
>
> Devin reads four repositories simultaneously: the monolith source code, the existing IaC patterns (Helm charts, Dockerfile, ArgoCD manifests), the platform standard (EKS cluster, namespaces, network policies, monitoring), and a landing repo where the new service will live. From a single prompt, Devin extracts the Inventory module, generates production-grade infrastructure-as-code, refactors the monolith to call the new service via HTTP, and creates PRs in both repos.
>
> **What makes this lab unique:** The extracted service must conform to organizational platform standards — namespace placement, network policies, resource quotas, monitoring integration, and GitOps deployment. This mirrors real enterprise decomposition work where "it compiles" is not enough; the service must be deployable and observable within the platform.
>
> **Who should attend:** DevOps engineers, platform engineers, solution architects, and engineering leads evaluating AI-assisted infrastructure-as-code generation and architectural decomposition.

---

## Prerequisites

### Repos Required on Devin's Machine

All four repos must be added via **Settings > Machine configuration > Add repository** before the lab:

- [x] [app_dotnet-angular-monolith](https://github.com/Cognition-Partner-Workshops/app_dotnet-angular-monolith) — .NET 8 + Angular 17 monolith (source)
- [x] [app_dotnet-angular-monolith-iac](https://github.com/Cognition-Partner-Workshops/app_dotnet-angular-monolith-iac) — Helm chart, Dockerfile, ArgoCD patterns (context)
- [x] [platform-engineering-shared-services](https://github.com/Cognition-Partner-Workshops/platform-engineering-shared-services) — EKS cluster, namespaces, monitoring (context)
- [x] [app_dotnet-angular-microservices](https://github.com/Cognition-Partner-Workshops/app_dotnet-angular-microservices) — landing repo for decomposed services + service-level IaC

All repos are in the [Cognition-Partner-Workshops](https://github.com/Cognition-Partner-Workshops) GitHub org.

### Branch Convention

Each participant works on a dedicated branch: **`workshop-<participant>`** (e.g., `workshop-alice`, `workshop-bob`). This prevents conflicts when multiple participants run the lab simultaneously. The branch name is included in the Devin session prompt.

### Participant Requirements

- [ ] Devin account on partner-workshops.devinenterprise.com
- [ ] GitHub access to `Cognition-Partner-Workshops` org (for PR review)
- [ ] Browser (Chrome recommended)

## Lab Walkthrough

### Phase 1 — Launch the Decomposition (5 min)

Create a new Devin session and paste the following prompt. Replace `<participant>` with your name (e.g., `workshop-alice`):

> Decompose the Inventory module from `app_dotnet-angular-monolith` into a standalone microservice.
>
> Work on branch `workshop-<participant>` in both repos.
>
> Use these repos as context for platform patterns and IaC standards:
> - `platform-engineering-shared-services` — defines the platform standard (namespaces, network policies, monitoring, ArgoCD)
> - `app_dotnet-angular-monolith-iac` — contains the existing Helm chart, Dockerfile, and ArgoCD patterns to follow
>
> Deliverables:
> 1. **New .NET 8 Web API** for the inventory-service with its own models, controllers, services, and EF Core DbContext
> 2. **Angular 17 frontend components** for inventory management
> 3. **Dockerfile** — multi-stage build following the pattern in `app_dotnet-angular-monolith-iac/docker/Dockerfile`
> 4. **Helm chart** — deployment, service, network policy, service monitor, HPA (follow `app_dotnet-angular-monolith-iac/helm/`)
> 5. **ArgoCD application manifests** for dev and staging (follow `app_dotnet-angular-monolith-iac/argocd/`)
> 6. **GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline** — build, test, push to ECR, trigger ArgoCD sync
> 7. **Monolith refactoring** — replace in-process Inventory calls with an HTTP client that calls the new service
>
> Push the new inventory-service code and all service-level IaC to `app_dotnet-angular-microservices` on branch `workshop-<participant>`. Create a PR.
> Push the monolith refactoring changes to `app_dotnet-angular-monolith` on branch `workshop-<participant>`. Create a PR.
> Build and test both services locally to verify they work together.

**What to expect:** Devin will read all four repos, analyze the domain boundaries, create a task plan, and begin extracting the Inventory module. This typically takes 10-15 minutes to produce initial PRs.

### Phase 2 — Explore While Devin Works (25 min)

While Devin is working autonomously, use these Devin features to deepen your understanding:

#### AskDevin (pre-session planning)

Open a new AskDevin conversation and try these questions:

- *"Analyze the domain boundaries in app_dotnet-angular-monolith. Which modules are tightly coupled and which have clean boundaries? What shared code exists between the Inventory module and other modules?"*
- *"Look at the Helm chart in app_dotnet-angular-monolith-iac and the namespace provisioning in platform-engineering-shared-services. What Kubernetes resources does a new microservice need to conform to the platform standard?"*
- *"What's the best HTTP client pattern in .NET 8 for service-to-service communication? Should we use IHttpClientFactory with typed clients or Refit?"*

#### DeepWiki (codebase exploration)

Open each repo's DeepWiki page to understand the architecture:

1. **app_dotnet-angular-monolith** — Understand the module structure, shared models, dependency graph between Orders/Products/Customers/Inventory. Identify what code belongs exclusively to Inventory vs. what is shared.
2. **platform-engineering-shared-services** — Understand the namespace provisioning pattern, network policy defaults, and monitoring setup. This defines what the new service must conform to.
3. **app_dotnet-angular-monolith-iac** — Understand the Helm chart structure, Dockerfile build stages, ArgoCD application configuration, and CI/CD pipeline. The new service's IaC should mirror these patterns.

#### Monitor Devin's Progress

Watch the session as Devin works. Key milestones to look for:
- Devin reads all four repos and identifies the Inventory bounded context
- Devin creates the new .NET 8 Web API project structure
- Devin generates the Helm chart, Dockerfile, and ArgoCD manifests
- Devin refactors the monolith to use an HTTP client
- Devin runs tests and creates PRs

### Phase 3 — Review PRs and Give Feedback (25 min)

Once Devin creates PRs, review them on GitHub:

#### Review the Monolith PR

- Does the HTTP client correctly replace all in-process Inventory calls?
- Is the `InventoryServiceClient` properly registered in DI?
- Are there any leftover direct references to Inventory models or DbSets?

#### Review the Microservices PR

- Does the inventory-service follow the platform standard?
- Does the Helm chart include network policies, service monitors, and HPA?
- Does the ArgoCD manifest target the correct namespace (`decomposition-dev`, `decomposition-staging`)?
- Does the directory structure match the expected layout?

**Expected directory structure in app_dotnet-angular-microservices:**
```
app_dotnet-angular-microservices/
├── inventory-service/
│   ├── src/                          <- .NET 8 Web API + Angular frontend
│   ├── tests/                        <- Unit and integration tests
│   ├── docker/
│   │   └── Dockerfile                <- Multi-stage build
│   ├── helm/
│   │   └── inventory-service/        <- Helm chart (deployment, service, networkpolicy, servicemonitor, hpa)
│   ├── argocd/
│   │   ├── application-dev.yaml
│   │   └── application-staging.yaml
│   └── .github/
│       └── workflows/
│           └── build-push.yaml       <- CI/CD pipeline
└── README.md
```

#### Leave Feedback Comments

Try leaving one of these PR comments and watch Devin respond:

- *"Add circuit breaker and retry logic to the InventoryServiceClient using Polly"*
- *"The Helm chart is missing a PodDisruptionBudget — add one with minAvailable: 1"*
- *"Add integration tests that verify the HTTP communication between the monolith and inventory-service"*

**What to expect:** Devin will read the comment, understand the request, implement the change, and push a new commit to the PR. This feedback loop typically takes 3-5 minutes per comment.

### Phase 4 — Bonus Challenges (15 min)

If time permits, extend the session with these follow-up prompts:

- *"Extract the Customers module next, following the same pattern you used for Inventory. Add it to app_dotnet-angular-microservices on the same workshop branch with its own Helm chart and ArgoCD manifests."*
- *"Add OpenTelemetry distributed tracing to both the monolith and inventory-service so we can trace requests across the HTTP boundary."*
- *"Create a Grafana dashboard JSON that shows inventory-service request rate, error rate, and p95 latency using the ServiceMonitor metrics."*

## Key Concepts

### Platform-Level vs. Service-Level Infrastructure

| Layer | What It Contains | Where It Lives |
|-------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Platform-level** | EKS cluster, VPC, namespaces, monitoring stack, ArgoCD, ingress controller | `platform-engineering-shared-services` |
| **Service-level** | Dockerfile, Helm chart, ArgoCD app manifest, CI/CD pipeline | `app_dotnet-angular-microservices` (per-service directory) |

The platform team owns the platform-level infrastructure. Each service team owns their service-level infrastructure but must conform to the platform standard (namespace placement, network policies, resource quotas, monitoring labels).

### The Four Repos

| Repo | Role | Modified? |
|------|------|-----------|
| `app_dotnet-angular-monolith` | Source — extract the Inventory module from here | Yes — refactored to use HTTP client |
| `app_dotnet-angular-microservices` | Landing — new service code + service-level IaC goes here | Yes — new inventory-service directory |
| `platform-engineering-shared-services` | Context — defines what the platform expects | No — read-only reference |
| `app_dotnet-angular-monolith-iac` | Context — provides IaC patterns to follow | No — read-only reference |

## Facilitator Notes

### Before the Lab

1. Verify all 4 repos are on the Devin machine snapshot (Settings > Machine configuration)
2. Confirm participants have Devin accounts and GitHub access
3. Pre-assign participant names (for `workshop-<participant>` branches) or let participants choose

### During the Lab

- **Phase 1 is hands-off** — participants submit the prompt and wait. Use this time to explain the architecture on a whiteboard or walk through the repos.
- **Phase 2 is exploratory** — encourage participants to use AskDevin and DeepWiki actively. This is a good time for questions.
- **Phase 3 is the most interactive** — participants review real PRs and leave real feedback. Walk around and help participants craft good PR comments.
- **If Devin finishes early** — move to Phase 4 bonus challenges or have participants compare results.

### Common Issues

- **Devin creates a separate repo instead of pushing to the landing repo:** The prompt explicitly says to push to `app_dotnet-angular-microservices`. If Devin tries to create a new repo, leave a comment redirecting it.
- **Branch conflicts between participants:** Each participant uses their own `workshop-<participant>` branch, so conflicts should not occur. If they do, it means two participants used the same name.
- **IaC doesn't match platform standard:** This is a good teaching moment. Have the participant leave a PR comment asking Devin to fix the conformance issue.

### After the Lab

- [ ] Collect participant feedback — especially: did Devin's IaC conform to the platform standard?
- [ ] Archive workshop branches if needed
- [ ] Update [DA8 module](../../modules/cloud-infrastructure/platform-conformant-microservice-decomposition.md) if issues were discovered
- [ ] Share session recordings/artifacts with participants

## Context

- **Tech Stack:** .NET 8, Angular 17, Kubernetes (EKS), Helm, ArgoCD, Terraform, GitHub Actions
- **Audience:** DevOps / Platform Engineering / Solution Architects
- **Key narrative:** Decomposing a monolith is not just about extracting code — the new service must be deployable, observable, and conformant with organizational platform standards. Devin handles both the code extraction and the IaC generation in a single session.
- **Enterprise value:** In real organizations, platform teams define standards and service teams must conform. This lab shows how Devin bridges the gap by reading platform standards and generating conformant service-level IaC automatically.
