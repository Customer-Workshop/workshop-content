| **Audience** | Development teams experiencing Devin hands-on for the first time |
| **Tracks** | Single progressive track: Migrate → Harden → Decompose → Build |
| **Event Site** | TBD |

## Workshop Overview

This is a hands-on workshop for teams getting their first experience with Devin. The labs are structured as a progressive ramp — starting with a test-enabled frontend migration, building to security remediation and a monolith decomposition, and finishing with greenfield feature development. By the end, participants will have used Devin to map a backend API and migrate an Angular frontend to React with a test safety net, remediate critical CVEs, extract a microservice from a monolith, and take a feature idea from requirements through implementation.

The workshop uses a mix of frontend, backend, and full-stack repositories. Each lab builds on a different Devin capability — API analysis and test generation, security scanning, architectural decomposition, and end-to-end feature development — so participants see the breadth of what Devin can do in a real engineering workflow.

> **Note:** This workshop runs against an external GitHub organization. The repos listed below will be available in your organization's GitHub workspace.

## Getting the Most from This Workshop

> **Devin works autonomously on its own machine.** Once you paste a prompt and kick off a session, Devin runs independently — you don't need to watch it. Move on to the next lab, explore Ask Devin, or grab coffee while it works. You'll get notified when it opens a PR.

A few tips to maximize your hands-on time:

- **Start sessions early, review later.** Each lab has a "Paste into Devin" step and a separate "Review & Give Feedback" step. Kick off the session first, then use the wait time for Ask Devin research — Devin will keep working in the background.
- **Overlap sessions.** Kick off Lab 2's Devin session while reviewing Lab 1's PR. Devin works in the background — there's no reason to wait. This is how teams use Devin in production.
- **Use Ask Devin to refine requirements.** The better-defined a task is, the better Devin's output. Ask Devin helps you think through the problem first so Devin can execute with less back-and-forth.
- **Leave PR comments to steer Devin.** After Devin opens a PR, you can leave comments directly and Devin will wake up and address them — this is the core workflow for iterating with Devin in production.
- **Build up Devin's knowledge as you go.** When Devin suggests a Knowledge item during a session, accept it — this is how teams build a shared context layer that makes Devin smarter over time.

## Lab 1 — Angular to React UI Migration (30 min)

**Value driver:** *Devin maps a backend API contract, writes a migration test suite as a safety net, then rewrites an Angular frontend in React — using parent-child session orchestration to parallelize the work and iterate until the migration passes its own test gate.*

- **Repository:** [petclinic-angular](https://github.com/Cognition-Partner-Workshops/petclinic-angular)
- **Modules:** [Framework Upgrade](../../../modules/migration-modernization/framework-upgrade.md)

The PetClinic Angular frontend is a full-featured veterinary clinic management UI with owners, pets, visits, vets, and specialties modules. It uses Angular 16, Angular Material, Bootstrap, RxJS, and template-driven forms. The app consumes a REST API at `localhost:9966/petclinic/api/` with 6 service files defining the full endpoint surface. Participants will ask Devin to map that API, spin up parallel child sessions for test creation and migration, then verify the migration passes its test gate.

### Paste into Devin

```
Migrate the petclinic-angular frontend from Angular to React
using a test-driven approach with parallel child sessions.

1. **Map the API contract:** Read the Angular service files
   and TypeScript interfaces. Produce docs/API_CONTRACT.md
   documenting each REST endpoint: HTTP method, URL pattern,
   request/response shapes, and error handling. Base URL is
   http://localhost:9966/petclinic/api/. Commit this to a
   new branch.

2. **Spin up two child sessions in parallel:**

   Child A — "In petclinic-angular, create React Testing
   Library + MSW tests in react-frontend/src/__tests__/
   validating owner CRUD, pet management, visit creation,
   and vet listing against docs/API_CONTRACT.md."

   Child B — "In petclinic-angular, migrate the Angular
   frontend to React 18+/TypeScript/Vite in react-frontend/.
   Preserve routing, form validation, error handling.
   npm run build must pass. Document gaps in
   docs/MIGRATION_NOTES.md."

3. **When both children finish:** Merge both PRs into a
   combined branch. Run the tests from Child A against
   the React app from Child B. Iterate until all tests
   pass — fix the React components to satisfy each failing
   test.
```

### While Devin works: try Ask Devin

Open **Ask Devin** and explore the Angular codebase:
- *"What REST API endpoints does petclinic-angular consume? Map the service files and the HTTP methods each uses."*
- *"What Angular-specific patterns does petclinic-angular use that don't have direct React equivalents (e.g., NgModules, resolvers, template-driven forms)?"*
- *"What would be the riskiest parts of migrating this app from Angular to React? Where would functional parity be hardest to achieve?"*

### Review the PR

When Devin opens PRs (you may see up to 3 — API contract, tests, migration):
- Does `API_CONTRACT.md` accurately reflect the endpoints in the Angular service files?
- Were the tests written independently from the migration code (Child A and Child B are separate sessions)?
- Do the migration tests pass against the final React app?
- Does the React app preserve the same routes and page structure as the Angular original?
- **Leave a comment** asking Devin to add accessibility attributes (aria-labels) to the migrated forms — watch Devin respond and push follow-up commits

### Key Takeaways

- **"Map before you migrate"** — Devin's `API_CONTRACT.md` documents the backend surface before any code is rewritten, making the migration auditable and reviewable
- **"Tests as a migration gate"** — the MSW-backed test suite is written independently from the migration code, then used to verify the React app exercises the same API contract the Angular app consumed
- **"Parallel child sessions"** — Devin orchestrates two agents working simultaneously: one writing tests, one migrating. This is the same divide-and-conquer pattern teams use for large migrations
- **"Iterative verification"** — the parent session merges both outputs and iterates until the migration passes its test gate, not just until it compiles

### Target Outcomes (any of these count)

- `docs/API_CONTRACT.md` documenting the REST endpoints the Angular app consumes
- Migration test suite in `react-frontend/src/__tests__/` with MSW handlers (from Child A)
- React 18+ app in `react-frontend/` with Vite + TypeScript (from Child B)
- All major pages migrated (owners, pets, visits, vets, specialties)
- Migration tests passing against the React app after iterative verification
- `npm run build` passing with zero TypeScript errors
- `docs/MIGRATION_NOTES.md` documenting translation decisions
- PR with migration artifacts and Devin's responses to review comments

## Lab 2 — Security Vulnerabilities Remediation (25 min)

**Value driver:** *Devin runs SAST scans, interprets CVE reports, remediates critical findings, and re-verifies — the scan-fix-rescan loop that normally takes a security engineer days.*

- **Repository:** [uc-cve-remediation-regulatory-compliance](https://github.com/Cognition-Partner-Workshops/uc-cve-remediation-regulatory-compliance)
- **Modules:** [Remediate Vulnerabilities](../../../modules/security/remediate-vulnerabilities.md), [Shift Left Security](../../../modules/security/shift-left-security.md)

This Spring Boot 2.6.3 application ships with known CVEs including Spring4Shell (CVSS 9.8), SnakeYAML unsafe deserialization (CVSS 9.8), and multiple Spring Security bypasses. OWASP Dependency-Check and SonarQube are pre-configured as Gradle plugins.

### Paste into Devin

```
Perform a security assessment of
uc-cve-remediation-regulatory-compliance and remediate the
most critical findings.

1. **Scan:** Run `./gradlew dependencyCheckAnalyze` to
   identify dependency CVEs. Categorize findings by CVSS
   severity.

2. **Remediate:** Fix the top 5 most critical vulnerabilities
   (CVSS >= 7.0). Start with Spring Boot 2.6.3
   (Spring4Shell), SnakeYAML 1.29, and sqlite-jdbc
   3.36.0.3. Upgrade dependencies to safe versions, fix any
   breaking API changes, and ensure `./gradlew build` still
   passes.

3. **Re-scan:** Run `./gradlew dependencyCheckAnalyze` again
   to verify the remediations resolved the findings.

4. **Document:** Create `SECURITY_REMEDIATION.md` with an
   executive summary, before/after findings table (CVE ID,
   severity, old version, new version, status), and any
   findings that could not be remediated and why.
```

### While Devin works: try Ask Devin

- *"What are the known CVEs in uc-cve-remediation-regulatory-compliance's dependencies? Which ones are CRITICAL severity?"*
- *"What's the safest upgrade path for Spring Boot 2.6.3 — should we go to 2.7.x first or jump straight to 3.x?"*
- *"Beyond dependency CVEs, are there any code-level security issues in this repo (SQL injection, insecure deserialization, hardcoded credentials)?"*

### Review the PR

When Devin opens a PR:
- Did Devin address both CRITICAL and HIGH findings?
- Does `SECURITY_REMEDIATION.md` show before/after evidence for each CVE?
- **Leave a comment:** *"Add a GitHub Actions workflow that runs OWASP Dependency-Check on every PR and fails on CVSS >= 7.0"* — watch Devin add shift-left security to the repo
- **Leave a comment:** *"Also add SBOM generation in CycloneDX format to the CI pipeline"*

### Key Takeaways

- **"Scan → fix → re-scan"** — Devin runs local SAST tools, interprets CVE reports, remediates findings, and verifies the fix in a closed loop
- **"Shift left via PR feedback"** — attendees ask Devin to add CI scanning as a PR comment, showing how security automation can be added iteratively
- **"Evidence-based compliance"** — the `SECURITY_REMEDIATION.md` provides auditable proof that remediation was effective

### Target Outcomes (any of these count)

- OWASP Dependency-Check report with critical CVEs remediated
- `SECURITY_REMEDIATION.md` with before/after evidence
- Build passing after dependency upgrades
- GitHub Actions CI workflow added via PR comment follow-up
- PR with remediations and Devin's responses to review comments

## Lab 3 — Monolith-to-Microservices Extraction (25 min)

**Value driver:** *Devin analyzes a monolith's domain boundaries, extracts a bounded context into a standalone service, wires up cross-service communication, and containerizes both — the architectural decomposition work that typically takes a team sprints to plan and execute.*

- **Repository:** [uc-spring-boot-upgrade-microservice-extraction](https://github.com/Cognition-Partner-Workshops/uc-spring-boot-upgrade-microservice-extraction)
- **Modules:** [Containerization & Microservice Extraction](../../../modules/migration-modernization/containerization-microservice-extraction.md)

This is a Spring Boot 2.6.3 / Java 11 monolith implementing the RealWorld blogging platform (Conduit) with 4 domain contexts: articles/tags, comments, favorites, and users/profiles. It has REST and GraphQL (DGS) APIs, MyBatis persistence with SQLite, Flyway migrations, 27 test files with an 80% Jacoco coverage gate, and a Next.js frontend. Participants will ask Devin to identify a bounded context, extract it into a standalone service, and prove the system still works.

### Paste into Devin

```
Analyze uc-spring-boot-upgrade-microservice-extraction — a
Spring Boot 2.6.3 monolith implementing the RealWorld
blogging platform with REST and GraphQL APIs, MyBatis
persistence, and a Next.js frontend.

1. **Analyze domain boundaries:** Map the bounded contexts
   (articles/tags, comments, favorites, users/profiles).
   Document your analysis in docs/EXTRACTION_DECISIONS.md —
   what moves to the new service, what stays, and why.

2. **Extract the Article context:** Create a standalone
   Spring Boot service in article-service/ with its own
   build configuration, database migrations, and persistence
   layer. Include articles, tags, comments, and favorites.

3. **Cross-service communication:** Replace direct method
   calls between Article and User domains with a REST
   client. Create DTOs for the service-to-service contract.

4. **Verify:** ./gradlew build passes for both services.
   Existing tests in the main app still pass after
   extraction. Do not attempt to fix pre-existing CI
   thresholds (e.g., JaCoCo coverage gates).
```

### While Devin works: try Ask Devin

- *"What are the domain boundaries in uc-spring-boot-upgrade-microservice-extraction? Which packages would form a natural microservice?"*
- *"What coupling exists between the Article domain and the User domain? How would you handle cross-service queries after extraction?"*
- *"What are the risks of extracting the Article bounded context? What shared infrastructure (security, database, Flyway) needs to be duplicated?"*

### Review the PR

When Devin opens a PR:
- Does `EXTRACTION_DECISIONS.md` clearly justify which domain objects moved and which stayed?
- Does the article-service have its own independent build that compiles?
- Is cross-service communication implemented via REST client (not shared database queries)?
- **Leave a comment:** *"Add a docker-compose.yml that runs both the main app and article-service with container networking"* — watch Devin containerize the decomposed system
- **Leave a comment:** *"Add a circuit breaker pattern to the REST client calls between services — what happens if article-service is down?"*

### Key Takeaways

- **"Domain analysis before decomposition"** — Devin reads the monolith, identifies bounded contexts, and documents extraction decisions before cutting any code
- **"Existing tests as a safety net"** — the monolith's test suite verifies that extraction didn't break functionality
- **"Service contracts, not shared databases"** — the extracted service communicates via REST DTOs, not direct database access — the right pattern for real microservices
- **"Containerization via PR feedback"** — attendees ask Devin to add Docker Compose as a follow-up, showing iterative architecture work through PR comments

### Target Outcomes (any of these count)

- `docs/EXTRACTION_DECISIONS.md` documenting domain boundary analysis and trade-offs
- Standalone `article-service/` with its own build configuration, migrations, and persistence
- REST client + DTOs for cross-service communication
- `./gradlew build` passing for both the main app and article-service
- Existing test suite still passing after extraction
- `docker-compose.yml` added via PR comment follow-up
- PR with extraction artifacts and Devin's responses to review comments

## Lab 4 — New Product Development: Ideas to Deployment (15 min)

**Value driver:** *Devin takes a feature idea from requirements gathering through full-stack implementation, testing, and deployment pipeline generation — demonstrating much of the product development lifecycle in a single session.*

- **Repository:** [timesheet-app](https://github.com/Cognition-Partner-Workshops/timesheet-app)
- **Modules:** [Gather Requirements](../../../modules/application-development/gather-requirements.md), [New Feature Development](../../../modules/application-development/new-feature-development.md), [Shift Left Security](../../../modules/security/shift-left-security.md)

The timesheet app is a React 19 + Node.js/Express + SQLite application for tracking billable hours. It has existing CRUD features for clients and work entries. Participants will take a new feature idea through the full lifecycle — from requirements to deployed artifact.

This lab runs in **two parallel sessions** to cover more ground:

### Paste into Devin

**Session A — Requirements & Implementation:**
```
Add a "Projects" management feature to timesheet-app. This
is a React 19 + Node.js/Express + SQLite app for tracking
billable hours.

1. **Requirements:** Create a GitHub Issue titled "Feature:
   Project Management" with user stories, acceptance
   criteria, data model (Projects table: id, name,
   description, client_id FK, start_date, end_date,
   status [active/completed/on-hold], budget_hours),
   and API endpoint specifications.

2. **Implement:** Build the full feature following existing
   patterns — backend Express routes, SQLite migration,
   frontend React components with MUI styling. Link
   projects to existing clients and work entries. Include
   backend API tests.
```

**Session B — Requirements for a Second Feature (optional, kick off in parallel):**
```
Analyze timesheet-app and propose a "Dashboard & Analytics"
feature. Create a detailed GitHub Issue with:
- User stories for a dashboard showing: total hours this week/
  month, hours by client breakdown (pie chart), hours trend
  over time (line chart), top projects by hours, utilization
  rate (logged hours vs. available hours)
- Technical design: which charting library to use (evaluate
  Recharts vs. Chart.js vs. Nivo), API endpoints needed for
  aggregation queries, database query designs
- Acceptance criteria for each dashboard widget
- Estimated implementation complexity for each component

Do not implement — just produce the requirements document as a
GitHub Issue. This shows how Devin can do technical discovery
and requirements gathering.
```

### While Devin works: try Ask Devin

- *"What patterns do the existing CRUD features (clients, work entries) follow in timesheet-app? What conventions should a new feature match?"*
- *"What database migration approach does the app use? How should I add a new table?"*
- *"What would a production deployment of timesheet-app look like? What infrastructure would it need?"*

### Review the PR

When Devin opens a PR:
- Does the Projects feature follow the same patterns as existing features (clients, work entries)?
- Is the GitHub Issue well-structured with clear acceptance criteria?
- **Leave a comment:** *"Add input validation for budget_hours — it should be a positive number. Also add a project status filter to the list view."*
- **Leave a comment:** *"Add a Dockerfile (multi-stage build) and a GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow that builds, tests, and produces a container image"* — watch Devin add deployment artifacts iteratively

### Key Takeaways

- **"Ideas to implementation in one session"** — Devin typically handles requirements → issue → implementation → tests in a single pass
- **"Pattern matching across features"** — Devin analyzes existing CRUD features and replicates the conventions for the new feature, typically maintaining consistency
- **"Requirements as a deliverable"** — the GitHub Issue serves as documentation and can be refined before implementation begins. Session B shows Devin doing pure discovery without writing code
- **"Deployment via PR feedback"** — attendees ask Devin to add a Dockerfile and CI workflow as a follow-up comment, showing how deployment artifacts are added iteratively

### Target Outcomes (any of these count)

- GitHub Issue with user stories and acceptance criteria
- New "Projects" feature with backend API + frontend UI
- Database migration script for the Projects table
- Backend API tests (Jest + Supertest)
- Dockerfile and CI/CD workflow added via PR comment follow-up
- PR with feature implementation and Devin's responses to review comments

## Post-Session Exercises

Participants who want to keep exploring after the workshop can try these additional use cases on their own. Each is self-contained with a copy-pasteable prompt.

### Exercise A: Test-Driven Development (TDD)

- **Repository:** [timesheet-app](https://github.com/Cognition-Partner-Workshops/timesheet-app)
- **Module:** [Test-Driven Development](../../../modules/application-development/test-driven-development.md)
- **Shows:** Devin writing failing tests from a feature specification, then implementing the feature to make them pass — a two-session TDD workflow

#### Paste into Devin

**Session 1 — Write Tests:**

```
I want to add a "duplicate work entry" feature to
timesheet-app. Write failing Jest tests for a new
POST /api/work-entries/:id/duplicate endpoint that
creates a copy of an existing work entry with today's
date.

Test: successful duplication, 404 for non-existent
entry, 403 for entry owned by another user. Commit
the tests to a new branch.
```

**Session 2 — Implement:**

```
The branch feature/duplicate-entry in timesheet-app has
failing tests for a new "duplicate work entry" feature.
Implement the feature so all tests pass. Do not modify
the test files.
```

---

### Exercise B: Java Upgrades/Modernization

- **Repository:** [uc-spring-boot-upgrade-microservice-extraction](https://github.com/Cognition-Partner-Workshops/uc-spring-boot-upgrade-microservice-extraction)
- **Module:** [Framework Upgrade](../../../modules/migration-modernization/framework-upgrade.md)
- **Shows:** Devin handling a major framework upgrade — javax→jakarta namespace migration, Spring Security 6 lambda DSL changes, and dependency compatibility fixes across a monolith with 80% test coverage

#### Paste into Devin

```
Upgrade uc-spring-boot-upgrade-microservice-extraction from
Java 11 + Spring Boot 2.6.3 to Java 17 + Spring Boot 3.2.

Handle the full upgrade checklist:
1. Update build.gradle — Spring Boot plugin, Java target
   compatibility, and dependency versions
2. Migrate javax.* imports to jakarta.* across all source
   files
3. Update Spring Security configuration to the new lambda
   DSL (Spring Security 6.x)
4. Fix any deprecated MyBatis or DGS (GraphQL) APIs
5. Update Flyway configuration for Spring Boot 3
   compatibility
6. Run ./gradlew build and ./gradlew test — fix any
   compilation errors or test failures
7. Document the breaking changes encountered and how each
   was resolved in the PR description
```

---

### Exercise C: COBOL Copybook to PySpark/JSON Config Generation

- **Repository:** [ts-cobol-carddemo](https://github.com/Cognition-Partner-Workshops/ts-cobol-carddemo)
- **Module:** [COBOL Copybook to PySpark/JSON](../../../modules/data-engineering/cobol-copybook-to-pyspark-json.md)
- **Shows:** Devin reading legacy COBOL data definitions and generating modern data engineering artifacts — cross-language translation at the schema level

#### Paste into Devin

```
Analyze the COBOL copybook `app/cpy/CVACT01Y.cpy` in
ts-cobol-carddemo. This defines the ACCOUNT-RECORD
layout (300 bytes) with fields like ACCT-ID
(PIC 9(11)), ACCT-CURR-BAL (PIC S9(10)V99), dates
(PIC X(10)), and FILLER.

Generate:
1. A PySpark script that reads
   `app/data/ASCII/acctdata.txt` as a fixed-width file
   using the copybook-derived schema
2. A JSON schema file describing each field's name,
   COBOL PIC clause, PySpark type, byte offset, and
   length
3. Validation output comparing parsed PySpark DataFrame
   row counts and sample values against the raw feed
   file

Then repeat for `CUSTREC.cpy` → `custdata.txt` and
`CVACT02Y.cpy` → `carddata.txt`.

Create a `COPYBOOK_PARSING_NOTES.md` documenting your
type-mapping decisions (e.g., COMP-3 → DecimalType,
PIC X → StringType).
```

## Known Limitations

A few things to be aware of as you work through the labs:

- **Lab 1 (Angular → React):** This lab uses parent-child session orchestration — Devin maps the API contract, then spins up two parallel child sessions (one for tests, one for migration). The migration tests use MSW (Mock Service Worker) to simulate the backend API. They verify the React app makes the correct API calls with the right data shapes — but they do not test against a running backend. To verify end-to-end, you can optionally start the PetClinic backend (petclinic-rest-api) locally and point the React app at it.
- **Lab 3 (Monolith Extraction):** The extraction starts from the monolith's current state (Spring Boot 2.6.3 / Java 11). The extracted article-service will also be on Spring Boot 2.6.3. For a Java 17 / Spring Boot 3.2 upgrade, see Exercise B in the post-session exercises.
- **Lab 4 (Ideas to Deployment):** Deployment artifacts (Dockerfile, CI workflow) are requested as PR comment follow-ups. There is no live deployment environment — the lab focuses on producing deployment-ready artifacts iteratively.
- **Each lab uses a different repository.** You'll work across four separate codebases rather than a single unified application.
