# Event Composition

This directory contains event-specific workshop configurations. Each event is a composition of challenges from `modules/` assembled into a time-boxed agenda.

## How to Create a New Event

1. Copy `_template/` to a new directory named `YYYY-MM-DD-location-org/`
2. Edit the `README.md` to fill in event details
3. Select challenges from `modules/` and list them in the agenda
4. Specify which repos need to be set up on Devin's machine
5. Note any runtime resources that need to be provisioned
