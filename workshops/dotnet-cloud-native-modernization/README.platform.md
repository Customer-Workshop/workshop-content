# Workshop: .NET Cloud-Native Modernization

**Other variants:** [Cloud only](README.md)

## Overview

| | |
|---|---|
| **Focus** | Progressive modernization of a monolithic .NET system to Kubernetes-hosted cloud-native APIs on EKS |
| **Duration** | 2.5-3 hours (configurable — see Duration Variants below) |
| **Audience** | .NET developers, solution architects, platform engineers, modernization teams |
| **Key Modules** | [.NET Monolith Decomposition](../../modules/migration-modernization/dotnet-monolith-decomposition.md), [Cross-Service Integration Testing](../../modules/testing-qa/cross-service-integration-testing.md), [Cross-Service Bug Investigation](../../modules/migration-modernization/cross-service-bug-investigation.md) |

## Platform Context

This workshop uses **Devin Desktop + Devin Cloud**. You will use Desktop as your primary interface — exploring code locally, delegating tasks to Cloud, and reviewing results without leaving the editor. Cloud agents handle long-running implementation work and deliver PRs that you review with one-click checkout.

> **Tip:** If you prefer to work entirely through the browser, see the [Cloud only](README.md) variant of this workshop, which uses the Devin web app at [app.devin.ai](https://app.devin.ai).

## Workshop Narrative

This workshop follows a progressive modernization sequence that mirrors how real enterprise teams decompose monoliths:

1. **Extract** — Decompose a bounded context from a .NET monolith into a containerized microservice with local hosting via Docker Compose
2. **Validate** — Write integration tests between the existing monolith and the newly extracted microservice to prove they work together
3. **Debug** — Investigate a cross-service bug in a service outside the scope of the translated code, demonstrating how Devin traces root causes across distributed systems

Each phase builds on the previous one, and all development uses local hosting alternatives (Docker Compose) so participants can test without cloud accounts. The target deployment platform is EKS, with Helm charts and platform conformance patterns available as context.

## Getting the Most from This Workshop

> **Devin Desktop is your command center.** You manage local and cloud agents from one place — the Agent Command Center. Explore code with Cascade or Devin Local, delegate implementation tasks to Devin Cloud, and review PRs with one-click checkout. Cloud agents keep working even when you move on to the next step.

A few tips to maximize your hands-on time:

- **Create a Space for this workshop.** Spaces group sessions, PRs, files, and context for a task. New sessions in the Space inherit your project context automatically.
- **Explore locally, execute in the cloud.** Use Cascade or Devin Local to understand the codebase first, then delegate the implementation to Devin Cloud for autonomous execution.
- **Monitor from the Agent Command Center.** The Kanban board shows the status of all your agents — local and cloud — in a single view. See at a glance what is in flight, what is blocked, and what is ready for review.
- **Review PRs without leaving Desktop.** When Devin Cloud opens a PR, use one-click checkout to review the diff and leave comments directly in the editor — no browser switching required.
- **Build up Devin's knowledge as you go.** When Devin suggests a Knowledge item, accept it — this is how teams build a shared context layer that compounds over time.
- **Try parallel sessions.** Running multiple cloud sessions simultaneously mirrors real enterprise usage. Track them from the Agent Command Center.
- **Mix agents when it helps.** Desktop supports multiple agents via ACP (Agent Client Protocol) — use whichever agent fits the task.

## Getting Started

Before beginning any lab, each participant creates a personal working branch from `main`:

```
git checkout main && git pull
git checkout -b workshop-<attendee_id>
```

Replace `<attendee_id>` with a unique identifier (e.g., name, employee ID). All work happens on this branch. This prevents conflicts when multiple participants run labs simultaneously against the same repos.

In Devin Desktop, create a **Space** for this workshop to group your sessions and PRs in one place.

## Labs

### Lab 1 — Monolith Decomposition & Containerization (75 min)

- **Module:** [.NET Monolith Decomposition with Local Hosting](../../modules/migration-modernization/dotnet-monolith-decomposition.md)
- **Repositories:**
  - [quickapp-monolith](https://github.com/Cognition-Partner-Workshops/quickapp-monolith) — .NET + Angular monolith (source)
  - [quickapp-microservices](https://github.com/Cognition-Partner-Workshops/quickapp-microservices) — target scaffold (reference)
  - [quickapp-iac](https://github.com/Cognition-Partner-Workshops/quickapp-iac) — Helm charts (context)
  - [platform-engineering-shared-services](https://github.com/Cognition-Partner-Workshops/platform-engineering-shared-services) — EKS platform standard (context)
- **Objective:** Extract the Order bounded context into a standalone .NET microservice with Docker Compose for local testing
- **Duration:** 75 min

#### Step 1: Explore with Cascade or Devin Local

Use Cascade or Devin Local in Desktop to explore the monolith's domain boundaries before delegating the extraction. Try questions like:

- *"Analyze the domain boundaries in the QuickApp monolith. Which bounded contexts have clean boundaries vs. tight coupling?"*
- *"What's the best strategy for splitting the shared EF Core DbContext into per-service databases?"*

Open each repo's DeepWiki page to understand the monolith's module structure, the target microservices scaffold, and the Helm chart patterns.

#### Step 2: Delegate to Devin Cloud

From Desktop, delegate the extraction task to Devin Cloud. Send the following prompt:

```
Extract the Order bounded context from quickapp-monolith into a
standalone .NET microservice. Work on branch
`workshop-<attendee_id>` in both repos. Use
quickapp-microservices as reference for the target architecture,
and quickapp-iac for Helm chart patterns. Deliverables:
(1) New .NET Web API for order-service,
(2) Shared contracts for inter-service communication,
(3) Dockerfile with multi-stage build,
(4) Docker Compose for local dev
    (monolith + order-service + PostgreSQL),
(5) Monolith refactored to use HTTP client,
(6) Integration smoke test.
Push to both repos and create PRs.
```

The cloud session appears in your Agent Command Center. Continue exploring locally or move to Step 3 while Cloud works.

#### Step 3: Monitor in the Agent Command Center

Track the cloud session's progress on the Kanban board. The session moves through statuses as Devin works — you can see when it is actively coding, waiting for CI, or ready for review.

#### Step 4: Review PRs in Desktop

When Devin Cloud opens PRs, use one-click checkout to review the diff directly in the editor. Leave comments to steer Devin — ask it to add circuit breaker logic, health checks, or improve the Docker Compose configuration.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Devin analyzes domain boundaries and coupling before extracting code
- Devin generates both application code and containerization artifacts in one session
- Local Docker Compose hosting means no cloud account needed for development and testing
- Desktop's one-click checkout streamlines the PR review cycle — no manual `git fetch` or browser switching

### Lab 2 — Integration Testing Between Monolith & Microservice (45 min)

- **Module:** [Cross-Service Integration Testing](../../modules/testing-qa/cross-service-integration-testing.md)
- **Repositories:** Same as Lab 1
- **Objective:** Write integration tests that validate the HTTP contract between the monolith and extracted Order service
- **Duration:** 45 min

#### Step 1: Explore with Cascade or Devin Local

Use Cascade or Devin Local to understand the contract surface before writing tests:

- *"What are the critical failure modes when the monolith calls the Order service?"*
- *"Should we use WebApplicationFactory or TestContainers for the integration tests?"*

Review both repos to understand the HTTP contract — find the HTTP client in the monolith and the controller endpoints in the Order service.

#### Step 2: Delegate to Devin Cloud

From Desktop, delegate the test generation to Devin Cloud:

```
Write integration tests for the HTTP contract between the
QuickApp monolith and the extracted Order microservice in
quickapp-microservices. Create:
(1) Integration test project,
(2) Docker Compose test configuration,
(3) Contract tests for all Order CRUD operations,
(4) End-to-end flow test
    (create customer -> place order -> verify in Order service),
(5) Shared DTO serialization roundtrip tests.
Work on branch `workshop-<attendee_id>`.
```

#### Step 3: Monitor in the Agent Command Center

If you kicked off Lab 1 and Lab 2 as parallel cloud sessions, the Kanban board shows both sessions side by side. This mirrors real enterprise usage where teams run multiple agents concurrently.

#### Step 4: Review PRs in Desktop

Use one-click checkout to review the generated tests. Ask Devin to add concurrent order creation tests, contract backwards-compatibility tests, or performance benchmarks.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Devin generates contract tests by analyzing both sides of the service boundary
- Docker Compose orchestrates test environments with no external dependencies
- Integration tests catch contract mismatches before they reach production
- The Agent Command Center gives visibility into parallel sessions running across labs

### Lab 3 — Cross-Service Bug Hunt (45 min)

- **Module:** [Cross-Service Bug Investigation](../../modules/migration-modernization/cross-service-bug-investigation.md)
- **Repository:**
  - [quickapp-microservices](https://github.com/Cognition-Partner-Workshops/quickapp-microservices)
- **Objective:** Find and fix a visual bug in the Notification service where order confirmation emails show amounts 100x smaller than the actual order total
- **Duration:** 45 min

#### Step 1: Explore with Cascade or Devin Local

Use Cascade or Devin Local in Desktop to trace the data flow before delegating the fix:

- *"Trace the data flow from OrderPlacedEvent to the rendered notification email. Where does the monetary amount get transformed?"*
- *"What does OrderPlacedEvent.TotalAmount represent — dollars or cents? Check the shared contract."*

Open the microservices repo's DeepWiki to understand the event flow from Order to Notification, the shared contracts library, and the rendering pipeline.

#### Step 2: Delegate to Devin Cloud

Once you understand the data flow, delegate the investigation and fix to Devin Cloud:

```
Order confirmation notification emails are showing wrong amounts
after the microservice decomposition. A $149.99 order shows as
$1.50 in the email preview. Investigate and fix this bug in
quickapp-microservices. Work on branch `workshop-<attendee_id>`.
Reproduce by running the notification-service and POSTing to
/api/notification/events/order-placed with
{"orderId":"11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111",
"customerId":"22222222-2222-2222-2222-222222222222",
"totalAmount":149.99,
"placedAt":"2026-03-17T12:00:00Z"}.
Open the preview URL — the total shows $1.50 instead of $149.99.
Find the root cause, fix it, take before/after screenshots, and
open a PR.
```

#### Step 3: Monitor in the Agent Command Center

Watch the cloud session's progress on the Kanban board. Devin will reproduce the bug, trace the root cause across services, apply the fix, and capture before/after screenshots.

#### Step 4: Review PRs in Desktop

Use one-click checkout to review the fix. Check that Devin removed the erroneous division and fixed the misleading comment. Ask for a regression test.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Devin traces bugs across microservice boundaries by following event/data flows
- Devin doesn't trust misleading code comments — it verifies against the actual data contract
- Visual bugs in HTML email previews are immediately verifiable via Devin's browser
- The bug is outside the scope of the code that was "translated" — Devin's intelligence finds root causes in unfamiliar services
- Desktop's local exploration (Step 1) builds understanding before delegating to Cloud — the local-to-cloud handoff in action

## Context

This workshop uses the C12 (.NET/Angular Containerized Decomposition) repo cluster. The monolith is imported from QuickApp, a real open-source .NET + Angular application with 5 bounded contexts. The microservices scaffold and IaC were generated to represent the target cloud-native architecture on EKS.

The workshop also references the existing [Platform-Conformant Microservice Decomposition](../platform-microservice-decomposition/) workshop (DA8), which uses a different .NET monolith family (OrderManager / C11 cluster). That workshop focuses on IaC conformance and multi-repo coordination; this workshop focuses on the progressive modernization journey with local hosting, integration testing, and cross-service debugging.
