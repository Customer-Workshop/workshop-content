# Workshop: Application Development and Maintenance

**Other variants:** [Cloud only](README.md) | [CLI variant](README.local.md)

## Overview

| | |
|---|---|
| **Focus** | Feature development, bug fixing, code maintenance, and database evolution — the full lifecycle of keeping applications healthy and growing |
| **Duration** | Flexible (3 tracks, 3 labs each) |
| **Audience** | Development teams, full-stack engineers, application owners, and team leads responsible for shipping features and maintaining production applications |
| **Tracks** | **Track A:** Feature Development · **Track B:** Bug Fixing & Root Cause Analysis · **Track C:** Maintenance & Evolution |

## Platform Context

This workshop uses **Devin Desktop + Devin Cloud**. You will use Desktop as your primary interface — exploring code locally, delegating tasks to Cloud, and reviewing results without leaving the editor. Cloud agents work autonomously on their own VMs while you continue coding locally.

> **Tip:** Devin Desktop supports multiple agents via ACP (Agent Client Protocol). You can run Cascade, Devin Local, or third-party agents (Codex CLI, Claude Agent, Gemini CLI) alongside Cloud sessions — all visible in the Agent Command Center.

## Workshop Narrative

This workshop covers the three pillars of application development and maintenance: building new capabilities, fixing production issues, and evolving the codebase over time. Each track is self-contained — participants can follow all three in sequence for a full-day experience, or focus on one or two tracks in a shorter session.

The tracks are designed to show Devin working across the application lifecycle:
- **Track A** shows Devin as a feature developer — gathering requirements locally, delegating implementation to Cloud, and reviewing PRs in-editor
- **Track B** shows Devin as a debugger and investigator — exploring code locally with Cascade or Devin Local, delegating fixes to Cloud, and tracing issues across service boundaries
- **Track C** shows Devin as a maintenance engineer — monitoring upgrade sessions in the Agent Command Center, evolving schemas, and refactoring tech debt

## Getting the Most from This Workshop

> **Devin Desktop is your command center.** You will use Devin Desktop to organize your work into Spaces, delegate tasks to Cloud agents, and review PRs — without leaving your editor. Cloud agents work on their own VMs in the background.

A few tips to maximize your hands-on time:

- **Create a Space for this workshop.** Spaces group sessions, PRs, files, and context for a specific task. Create one Space per track (or one for the whole workshop) so everything stays organized.
- **Use Cascade or Devin Local for exploration.** Instead of Ask Devin in the browser, use Desktop's local agents for code research and requirements gathering. They have direct access to your files and respond interactively.
- **Delegate implementation to Cloud.** Once you've refined requirements locally, send the task to Devin Cloud with one click. Cloud agents work autonomously while you continue coding locally.
- **Monitor progress in the Agent Command Center.** The Kanban board shows all your agents — local and cloud — organized by status. See at a glance what is in flight, what is blocked, and what is ready for review.
- **Review PRs with one-click checkout.** When a Cloud agent opens a PR, review it directly in the editor — no browser switching, no manual `git fetch`.
- **Build up Devin's knowledge as you go.** When Devin suggests a Knowledge item during a session, accept it — this is how teams build a shared context layer that makes Devin smarter over time. The same knowledge works across Desktop and Cloud.
- **Leave PR comments to steer Devin.** After Devin opens a PR, the PR Review agent and CI checks provide automatic feedback loops. You can also leave comments directly on the PR and Devin will wake up and address them — this is the core workflow for iterating with Devin in production.

### Desktop Workflow (replaces the web-app workflow)

Each lab in this workshop follows a five-step Desktop workflow:

1. **Create a Space** — Open Devin Desktop and create a Space for the lab (or use your workshop Space)
2. **Explore locally** — Use Cascade or Devin Local to research the codebase, understand patterns, and refine requirements
3. **Delegate to Cloud** — Send the implementation task to Devin Cloud from Desktop. The cloud agent runs on its own VM
4. **Monitor in Agent Command Center** — Track progress on the Kanban board. Start the next lab while Cloud works
5. **Review with one-click checkout** — When the Cloud agent opens a PR, check it out in the editor, review, comment, and merge

## Track A: Feature Development

Track A demonstrates Devin as a feature developer. Participants will build full-stack CRUD features, implement API endpoints with test-driven development, and turn vague requirements into working implementations — using Desktop for exploration and Cloud for implementation.

### Lab A1 — Full-Stack CRUD Feature

- **Module:** [New Feature Development](../../modules/application-development/new-feature-development.md)
- **Repositories:**
  - [timesheet-app](https://github.com/Cognition-Partner-Workshops/timesheet-app) — React 19 + Node.js/Express + SQLite full-stack application
  - [ts-java-angular-jhipster](https://github.com/Cognition-Partner-Workshops/ts-java-angular-jhipster) — Angular + Spring Boot JHipster monolith (alternative)
- **Objective:** Build a complete new feature — backend API, database schema, frontend UI, and tests — following existing codebase conventions

#### Step 1: Explore locally with Cascade or Devin Local

Open Devin Desktop and use Cascade or Devin Local to scope the feature before delegating to Cloud:
- *"What existing patterns does timesheet-app use for CRUD features? What data model, API structure, and React component conventions should a new feature follow?"*
- *"What database migration approach does the app use? How are new tables created?"*

Use what you learn to refine the task before sending it to Cloud.

#### Step 2: Delegate to Devin Cloud from Desktop

Send the implementation task to Devin Cloud. The cloud agent will work autonomously on its own VM:

**Option A — React + Node.js (timesheet-app):**
```
Add a "Projects" management feature to timesheet-app. Users should be able to create, view, edit, and delete projects. Each project has a name, description, client assignment, start date, and status (active/completed/on-hold). Add both the backend API endpoints and the frontend UI page. Follow the existing patterns in the codebase for the data model, API structure, and React components. Write tests for the backend endpoints.
```

**Option B — Angular + Spring Boot (JHipster):**
```
Add an "Invoice" management feature to ts-java-angular-jhipster. Users should be able to create, view, edit, and delete invoices. Each invoice has a number, date, due date, amount, status (draft/sent/paid/overdue), and is linked to a bank account. Add both the Spring Boot backend (JPA entity, REST controller, service layer) and the Angular frontend (list view, create/edit form, detail view). Follow JHipster conventions for entity generation patterns. Write JUnit tests for the backend.
```

Monitor the cloud session in the **Agent Command Center** while it works. You can start the next lab or continue exploring locally.

#### Step 3 (Optional): Read the DeepWiki

Open the repo's **DeepWiki** page to understand the existing feature patterns. Use what you learn to try different approaches:
- Have Devin add **validation rules** for the new feature (e.g., project dates must not overlap, invoice amounts must be positive)
- Ask Devin to add **frontend tests** (React Testing Library or Angular TestBed) for the new UI components
- Try having Devin add **audit logging** for all CRUD operations
- Ask Devin to generate **API documentation** (Swagger/OpenAPI) for the new endpoints

#### Step 4 (Optional): Review PR with one-click checkout

When the Cloud agent opens a PR, review it directly in Devin Desktop — one-click checkout, no browser switching:
- **PR Review will automatically analyze the PR** and flag potential issues — missing validation, error handling gaps, security concerns, or logic bugs
- **Read the PR Review comments carefully** — they often catch real issues
- **Leave your own feedback** alongside the PR Review comments:
  - *"PR Review flagged that the project name field has no length validation — please add max length checking"*
  - *"Add error handling for the case where a client is deleted while it has active projects"*
  - *"The React component doesn't handle loading states — add a spinner while the API call is in flight"*

See the full challenge details for [New Feature Development](../../modules/application-development/new-feature-development.md) for more ideas.

- **Key Takeaways:**
  - **"Devin follows existing patterns"** — it analyzes the codebase's conventions before implementing, producing code that fits the existing architecture
  - **"PR Review catches what humans miss"** — the automated review agent flags validation gaps, error handling issues, and potential bugs before you even look at the PR
  - **"Desktop keeps you in flow"** — explore locally, delegate to Cloud, review in-editor. No context switching to the browser
  - **"Knowledge compounds over time"** — if Devin discovers project conventions during this session, save them as Knowledge items. Future sessions will automatically benefit

- **Target Outcomes (any of these count):**
  - New feature implemented following existing code conventions
  - Unit tests and/or integration tests for the new feature
  - Database schema changes with migration scripts
  - Frontend UI components for the new feature
  - PR Review comments identifying potential issues
  - Devin's responses to both PR Review and human feedback

### Lab A2 — API Feature with TDD

- **Module:** [Test-Driven Development](../../modules/application-development/test-driven-development.md)
- **Repositories:**
  - [uc-spring-boot-upgrade-microservice-extraction](https://github.com/Cognition-Partner-Workshops/uc-spring-boot-upgrade-microservice-extraction) — Spring Boot 2.6.3 RealWorld app with JUnit infrastructure
  - [uc-bdd-test-generation-cucumber](https://github.com/Cognition-Partner-Workshops/uc-bdd-test-generation-cucumber) — Spring Boot + Cucumber BDD framework (alternative)
- **Objective:** Implement a new API feature using test-driven development — write failing tests first, then implement until they pass

#### Step 1: Delegate to Devin Cloud from Desktop

Send the TDD task to Devin Cloud from Desktop:

**Option A — TDD with JUnit (Spring Boot RealWorld):**
```
Using test-driven development, add an "article statistics" feature to uc-spring-boot-upgrade-microservice-extraction. First, write failing JUnit tests for two new endpoints: GET /api/articles/:slug/stats (returns view count, favorite count, comment count, days since published) and GET /api/stats/trending (returns top 10 most-favorited articles in the last 7 days). Then implement the endpoints to make the tests pass. Follow existing code patterns. showing the TDD progression (tests written first, then implementation).
```

**Option B — BDD-First (Cucumber):**
```
Using behavior-driven development, add an order management feature to uc-bdd-test-generation-cucumber. First, write Gherkin feature files describing the behavior: create an order, list orders, get order by ID, update order status, delete order. Then implement an OrderController, OrderService, and Order entity to make all scenarios pass. Follow existing project patterns for step definitions and entity structure.
```

#### Step 2: Explore locally while Cloud works

While the Cloud agent works on the TDD task, use **Cascade or Devin Local** in Desktop to explore:
- *"What are the existing test patterns in uc-spring-boot-upgrade-microservice-extraction? How are controller tests structured?"*
- *"What's the difference between MockMvc tests and integration tests in this codebase? Which is more appropriate for API endpoint testing?"*
- *"How does the Cucumber framework in uc-bdd-test-generation-cucumber handle test data setup and teardown?"*

Check the **Agent Command Center** to monitor your Cloud session's progress.

#### Step 3 (Optional): Read the DeepWiki

Open the repo's **DeepWiki** page to understand the test infrastructure. Try:
- Have Devin add **negative test cases** (invalid inputs, unauthorized access, not-found scenarios)
- Ask Devin to add **data-driven tests** using parameterized JUnit or Cucumber Scenario Outlines
- Try having Devin add **contract tests** that verify the API response shape

#### Step 4 (Optional): Review PR with one-click checkout

When the Cloud agent opens a PR, check it out in Desktop and focus your review on **TDD discipline**:
- **Test-first evidence:** Can you see from the commit history that tests were written before implementation?
- **Test quality:** Are the tests checking real behavior or just trivially asserting?
- **Edge cases:** Does the implementation handle boundary conditions discovered during TDD?

**Leave a feedback comment** and watch Devin respond:
- *"Add a test for when the article slug doesn't exist — should return 404"*
- *"The trending endpoint should handle the case where there are fewer than 10 articles"*
- *"Add an integration test that verifies the database query performance"*

- **Key Takeaways:**
  - **"Tests-first produces better APIs"** — writing tests before code forces you to think about the API contract from the consumer's perspective
  - **"Devin demonstrates TDD discipline"** — the commit history shows tests written first, then implementation, making the process visible to reviewers
  - **"BDD bridges dev and business"** — Gherkin scenarios are readable by non-developers, making test suites a communication tool
  - **"Agent Command Center gives visibility"** — monitor TDD progress on the Kanban board while exploring locally

- **Target Outcomes (any of these count):**
  - Failing tests written before implementation
  - All tests passing after implementation
  - Clear TDD commit progression visible in PR history
  - Edge case and negative test coverage
  - PR with TDD evidence and review iterations

### Lab A3 — Requirements to Implementation

- **Modules:** [Gather Requirements](../../modules/application-development/gather-requirements.md) + [New Feature Development](../../modules/application-development/new-feature-development.md)
- **Repositories:**
  - [timesheet-app](https://github.com/Cognition-Partner-Workshops/timesheet-app) — React + Node.js full-stack application
  - [uc-data-source-migration-jdbc-normalization](https://github.com/Cognition-Partner-Workshops/uc-data-source-migration-jdbc-normalization) — Spring Boot loan management service (alternative)
- **Objective:** Start from vague business requirements, use local agents to refine them into technical specifications, then delegate to Cloud for implementation — the full requirements-to-code pipeline

#### Step 1: Gather requirements with Cascade or Devin Local

This lab starts with requirements gathering. Open **Cascade or Devin Local** in Desktop and work through these prompts to build up a specification:

1. *"A manager wants to see which team members are overloaded this week. What data does timesheet-app already have that could power a 'team workload' dashboard? What's missing?"*
2. *"Based on the existing data model, design a 'Team Workload Dashboard' feature. What API endpoints are needed? What calculations should the backend perform? What should the UI show?"*
3. *"Write a detailed technical specification for the workload dashboard — include the data model, API contract (request/response shapes), and UI wireframe description."*

#### Step 2: Delegate to Devin Cloud (using the refined spec from step 1)

Take the technical specification from your local exploration and delegate it to Devin Cloud from Desktop:

```
Implement the following feature for timesheet-app based on this specification:

[Paste the technical spec from your Cascade/Devin Local session here]

Follow existing code patterns. Add backend API endpoints, frontend React components, and tests.
```

Alternatively, if you want to try a less-refined approach:

```
A manager wants a "Team Workload Dashboard" in timesheet-app. They should be able to see: which team members have logged the most hours this week, who has upcoming deadlines, and which clients have the most active work entries. Figure out the best way to implement this given the existing data model and codebase patterns. Add backend calculations, an API endpoint, and a frontend dashboard page.
```

#### Step 3 (Optional): Read the DeepWiki

Open the repo's **DeepWiki** page to understand the data model. Compare what your local agent suggested with what's actually available in the database.

#### Step 4 (Optional): Review PR with one-click checkout

Focus your review on whether the implementation matches the requirements:
- **Requirements fit:** Does the feature solve the manager's original problem?
- **Data accuracy:** Are the workload calculations correct?
- **UX quality:** Is the dashboard useful and intuitive?

**Leave a feedback comment:**
- *"Add a date range picker so managers can look at workload for different weeks"*
- *"The overload threshold should be configurable, not hard-coded at 40 hours"*
- *"Add a CSV export for the workload summary"*

- **Key Takeaways:**
  - **"Local exploration → Cloud implementation"** — refining requirements locally with Cascade or Devin Local before delegating to Cloud produces better results
  - **"Vague requirements still work"** — Devin can infer reasonable implementations from business-level descriptions, but refined specs produce better output
  - **"Spaces keep context organized"** — your local exploration, cloud session, and PR all live in one Space
  - **"DeepWiki validates feasibility"** — checking the data model before implementation catches impossible requirements early

- **Target Outcomes (any of these count):**
  - Technical specification produced via local agent (Cascade or Devin Local)
  - Feature implemented matching the specification
  - Backend API with calculations and frontend dashboard
  - Tests verifying the feature logic
  - PR with implementation and review iterations

## Track B: Bug Fixing & Root Cause Analysis

Track B demonstrates Devin as a debugger and investigator. Participants will hunt for bugs in running applications, trace issues across service boundaries, and fix data-related bugs with proper root cause analysis — using Desktop's local agents for exploration and Cloud for fixes.

### Lab B1 — Exploratory Bug Hunting

- **Module:** [Fix Runtime Bug](../../modules/application-development/fix-runtime-bug.md)
- **Repositories:**
  - [timesheet-app](https://github.com/Cognition-Partner-Workshops/timesheet-app) — React + Node.js full-stack application
  - [calcom](https://github.com/Cognition-Partner-Workshops/calcom) — Open-source scheduling platform (alternative, more complex)
- **Objective:** Start a running application, explore it to find bugs or unexpected behavior, then have Devin fix what it finds — demonstrating exploratory testing and debugging

#### Step 1: Delegate to Devin Cloud from Desktop

Send the bug-hunting task to Cloud from Desktop:

```
Start timesheet-app locally (backend: `cd backend && npm run dev`, frontend: `cd frontend && npm run dev`). Explore the application — create work entries, manage clients, try the reporting features, test edge cases (empty inputs, special characters, date boundaries, concurrent operations). Find and document any bugs or unexpected behavior. Fix the most impactful bug you find. Take before/after screenshots. Write a `ROOT_CAUSE_ANALYSIS.md` explaining the bug, why it happened, and how you fixed it.
```

#### Step 2: Explore locally while Cloud investigates

While the Cloud agent hunts for bugs, use **Cascade or Devin Local** in Desktop to explore:
- *"What are the most common types of bugs in Express + React applications? What should I look for?"*
- *"What error handling patterns does timesheet-app use? Are there any gaps?"*
- *"What edge cases are most likely to have bugs — date handling, number formatting, empty states, concurrent access?"*
- Use the analysis to delegate a **second Cloud session** targeting a different area of the application

#### Step 3 (Optional): Read the DeepWiki

Open the repo's **DeepWiki** page to understand the application architecture:
- Identify components that might have bugs (complex state management, API error handling, date/time logic)
- Look at the data flow from frontend form submission to database write
- Find areas with minimal test coverage — bugs are more likely here

Try different approaches:
- Have Devin add a **regression test** for any bug it finds
- Ask Devin to check for **similar bugs** elsewhere in the codebase
- Try having Devin produce a **debugging narrative** that traces the issue from symptom to root cause

#### Step 4 (Optional): Review PR with one-click checkout

When the Cloud agent opens a PR, review it in Desktop and focus on the **root cause analysis**:
- **Root cause:** Does the analysis explain *why* the bug happened, not just *what* was changed?
- **Fix quality:** Does the fix address the root cause or just the symptom?
- **Regression prevention:** Is there a test that will catch this bug if it's reintroduced?

**Leave a feedback comment** and watch Devin respond:
- *"Add a regression test for this bug"*
- *"Are there any other places in the codebase that make the same assumption?"*
- *"The fix handles the immediate case but what happens if the input is null?"*

- **Key Takeaways:**
  - **"Devin debugs like a developer"** — it reproduces bugs via the browser, traces data flows, reads logs, and identifies root causes
  - **"Local + Cloud in parallel"** — explore code locally while Cloud runs the application and hunts for bugs. Multiple agents, one view
  - **"Screen recordings as evidence"** — Devin's before/after screenshots provide visual proof that the fix works
  - **"Root cause analysis prevents recurrence"** — understanding *why* a bug happened is more valuable than just fixing it

- **Target Outcomes (any of these count):**
  - Bug identified with reproduction steps
  - Root cause analysis documented in `ROOT_CAUSE_ANALYSIS.md`
  - Fix implemented with before/after evidence (screenshots or screen recording)
  - Regression test added
  - PR with fix explanation and Devin's responses to review comments

---

### Lab B2 — Cross-Service Bug Investigation

- **Module:** [Fix Runtime Bug](../../modules/application-development/fix-runtime-bug.md) + [Cross-Service Bug Investigation](../../modules/migration-modernization/cross-service-bug-investigation.md)
- **Repositories:**
  - [quickapp-microservices](https://github.com/Cognition-Partner-Workshops/quickapp-microservices) — decomposed .NET microservices with a planted cross-service bug
  - [eventflow-order-service](https://github.com/Cognition-Partner-Workshops/eventflow-order-service) + [eventflow-payment-service](https://github.com/Cognition-Partner-Workshops/eventflow-payment-service) — EventFlow multi-service application (alternative)
- **Objective:** Investigate a bug that manifests in one service but has its root cause in another — demonstrating Devin's ability to trace issues across service boundaries

#### Step 1: Delegate to Devin Cloud from Desktop

Send the investigation task to Cloud:

**Option A — .NET Microservices (notification amount bug):**
```
Order confirmation notification emails are showing wrong amounts after the microservice decomposition. A $149.99 order shows as $1.50 in the email preview. Investigate and fix this bug in quickapp-microservices. To reproduce: run the notification-service locally, POST to `http://localhost:5005/api/notification/events/order-placed` with `{"orderId": "11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111", "customerId": "22222222-2222-2222-2222-222222222222", "totalAmount": 149.99, "placedAt": "2026-03-17T12:00:00Z"}`, then open the preview URL — the total shows $1.50 instead of $149.99. Find the root cause, fix it, take before/after screenshots, and include a root cause analysis.
```

**Option B — EventFlow (currency precision bug):**
```
The EventFlow payment service is incorrectly processing JPY (Japanese Yen) orders. JPY is a zero-decimal currency but the payment service is dividing by 100 like other currencies, resulting in incorrect amounts. Investigate the payment processing logic in eventflow-payment-service, identify where zero-decimal currency handling should be added, fix the bug, and add unit tests covering JPY, USD, and EUR.
```

#### Step 2: Trace locally while Cloud investigates

While the Cloud agent works, use **Cascade or Devin Local** in Desktop to explore the data contracts:
- *"Trace the data flow from when an OrderPlacedEvent is received to when the notification email is rendered. Where does the monetary amount get transformed?"*
- *"What does the OrderPlacedEvent.TotalAmount field represent — dollars or cents? Check the shared contract definition."*
- *"What are zero-decimal currencies and which payment APIs handle them differently? How should JPY amounts be processed?"*

#### Step 3 (Optional): Read the DeepWiki

Open the repo's **DeepWiki** page to understand the event flow between services:
- Trace the data contract from Order service to Notification/Payment service
- Identify shared libraries and their assumptions about data formats
- Look for misleading comments that might be hiding the bug

#### Step 4 (Optional): Review PR with one-click checkout

Focus your review on whether the fix is complete:
- **Root cause identified:** Is it a data format mismatch, unit conversion error, or shared contract issue?
- **Fix scope:** Does the fix only change the symptom service, or does it address the source of truth?
- **All affected paths:** Are there other services that might have the same bug?

**Leave a feedback comment:**
- *"Are there any other notification types that format monetary amounts? Check those too."*
- *"Add a contract test that verifies both services agree on the amount format"*
- *"Add a unit test for FormatCurrency that verifies $149.99 renders as '$149.99' and not '$1.50'"*

- **Key Takeaways:**
  - **"Cross-service tracing"** — Devin follows data across service boundaries and shared contracts to find root causes that live outside the symptom's service
  - **"Don't trust comments"** — the cross-service bug includes a misleading code comment. Devin learns to verify against the actual data contract
  - **"Shared contracts are the source of truth"** — when services disagree, the contract definition is authoritative
  - **"Contract tests prevent regression"** — adding tests that verify inter-service agreements catches future mismatches early

- **Target Outcomes (any of these count):**
  - Root cause identified across service boundaries
  - Fix applied to the correct service (source of the bug, not just the symptom)
  - Before/after screenshots or screen recording
  - Contract test or regression test added
  - PR with root cause analysis documenting the data flow

---

### Lab B3 — Data Bug & Schema Fix

- **Modules:** [Fix Data Bug](../../modules/application-development/fix-data-bug.md) + [Database Schema Evolution](../../modules/application-development/database-schema-evolution.md)
- **Repositories:**
  - [uc-data-source-migration-jdbc-normalization](https://github.com/Cognition-Partner-Workshops/uc-data-source-migration-jdbc-normalization) — Spring Boot loan service with legacy CDW-style tables
  - [timesheet-app](https://github.com/Cognition-Partner-Workshops/timesheet-app) — React + Node.js app with SQLite (alternative)
- **Objective:** Investigate and fix a data-related bug — incorrect query results, type conversion errors, or schema inconsistencies — and evolve the schema to prevent recurrence

#### Step 1: Delegate to Devin Cloud from Desktop

**Option A — Legacy Data Types (loan service):**
```
The loan service in uc-data-source-migration-jdbc-normalization is reading from legacy CDW-style tables where all columns are VARCHAR (including amounts, dates, and IDs). Some loan balance queries return incorrect results because string comparison is used instead of numeric comparison — for example, a loan with balance "99.50" appears as greater than one with balance "1000.00" because string sort puts "9" after "1". Identify all repository queries that compare or sort numeric VARCHAR fields. Fix the queries to properly cast to numeric types. Add JUnit tests that verify correct ordering and comparison. Document the fix in a `DATA_BUG_ANALYSIS.md`.
```

**Option B — SQLite Type Issues (timesheet app):**
```
Investigate the date handling in timesheet-app's backend. SQLite stores dates as text, which can cause issues with date range queries, sorting, and timezone handling. Find any bugs related to date storage or retrieval (e.g., work entries on boundary dates not appearing in reports, timezone-related off-by-one errors). Fix the issues and add tests that verify correct behavior across date boundaries.
```

#### Step 2: Explore the data layer locally

While Cloud investigates, use **Cascade or Devin Local** to explore:
- *"What are the most common bugs when reading from all-VARCHAR legacy tables? How do type coercion issues manifest?"*
- *"What's the correct way to handle numeric comparison in JPA/JPQL when the underlying column is VARCHAR?"*
- *"What SQLite-specific date handling gotchas should I be aware of?"*

#### Step 3 (Optional): Read the DeepWiki

Open the repo's **DeepWiki** page to understand the data layer. Try:
- Have Devin add **database constraints** that prevent invalid data from being stored
- Ask Devin to create a **data validation migration** that checks existing data for type issues
- Try having Devin add **query-level assertions** that verify return types match expectations

#### Step 4 (Optional): Review PR with one-click checkout

Focus your review on **data correctness**:
- **Query fix:** Are all numeric comparisons now using proper casting?
- **Migration safety:** Will the schema change work with existing data?
- **Test coverage:** Do tests cover the boundary conditions that triggered the original bug?

**Leave a feedback comment:**
- *"What happens if a VARCHAR field contains non-numeric data like 'N/A'? Add error handling."*
- *"Add a test with the specific values that triggered the original bug"*
- *"Create a database migration that adds CHECK constraints to prevent future invalid data"*

- **Key Takeaways:**
  - **"Data bugs are subtle"** — they produce wrong results without throwing errors, making them harder to detect than crashes
  - **"Legacy schemas require defensive coding"** — when the database doesn't enforce types, the application must
  - **"Schema evolution is part of the fix"** — fixing the query is necessary, but adding constraints prevents recurrence
  - **"Tests must use realistic data"** — test data that doesn't hit boundary conditions won't catch the bugs that matter

- **Target Outcomes (any of these count):**
  - Data bug identified with specific examples of incorrect behavior
  - Query or schema fix applied with proper type handling
  - `DATA_BUG_ANALYSIS.md` documenting the issue and fix
  - Tests with boundary-condition data proving the fix
  - PR with analysis and evidence

## Track C: Maintenance & Evolution

Track C demonstrates Devin as a maintenance engineer. Participants will set up automated dependency upgrades, evolve database schemas safely, and refactor tech debt — monitoring everything from the Agent Command Center in Desktop.

### Lab C1 — Dependency Upgrades & Scheduled Maintenance

- **Modules:** [Upgrade Dependencies](../../modules/security/upgrade-dependencies.md)
- **Repositories:**
  - [uc-cve-remediation-regulatory-compliance](https://github.com/Cognition-Partner-Workshops/uc-cve-remediation-regulatory-compliance) — Spring Boot app with Gradle
  - [timesheet-app](https://github.com/Cognition-Partner-Workshops/timesheet-app) — Node.js app with npm (alternative)
- **Objective:** Upgrade dependencies to latest minor/patch versions, verify the build passes, and set up a recurring Devin scheduled session for automated weekly maintenance

#### Step 1: Delegate to Devin Cloud from Desktop

Send the upgrade task to Cloud:

```
Check all dependencies in uc-cve-remediation-regulatory-compliance for available minor and patch version updates. Upgrade each dependency to the latest minor version (do not jump major versions). Run `./gradlew build` and `./gradlew test` to verify the build still passes after each upgrade. If any upgrade breaks the build, revert that specific upgrade and document why. Create a `DEPENDENCY_UPDATES.md` listing what was upgraded, from which version to which version, and any upgrades that were skipped (with reasons). Title the PR "chore: weekly dependency version bump".
```

#### Step 2: Research locally while Cloud upgrades

While Cloud works, use **Cascade or Devin Local** in Desktop to explore:
- *"What dependencies in uc-cve-remediation-regulatory-compliance are the most out of date? Which ones have the most available minor/patch updates?"*
- *"What's the difference between minor and patch version upgrades in terms of risk? When is it safe to auto-upgrade vs. requiring human review?"*
- *"How should a team handle dependency upgrades that break the build — auto-revert and flag, or block and notify?"*
- Consider creating a **Devin Knowledge item** capturing the dependency upgrade policy

Monitor upgrade progress in the **Agent Command Center** — especially useful when running upgrades across multiple repos in parallel.

#### Step 3 (Optional): Set Up a Scheduled Session

Once you're happy with the output from step 1, turn it into a recurring task:

```
Create a Devin scheduled session that runs weekly on Monday mornings against uc-cve-remediation-regulatory-compliance. The schedule should use this prompt: "Check all dependencies for available minor and patch version updates. Upgrade to the latest minor versions. Run the full test suite and build to verify nothing is broken. If any upgrade breaks the build, revert that specific upgrade and note it in a DEPENDENCY_UPDATES.md."
```

#### Step 4 (Optional): Extend to Multiple Repos

Try running the same pattern for **timesheet-app** with an npm-flavored prompt:

```
Check all npm dependencies in timesheet-app for available minor and patch version updates. Run `npm update` to upgrade to latest minor versions. Run `npm test` and `npm run build` to verify everything still works. Document the changes in a `DEPENDENCY_UPDATES.md`.
```

Use the **Agent Command Center** in Desktop to track both upgrade sessions side by side on the Kanban board.

- **Key Takeaways:**
  - **"Automate the boring stuff"** — dependency upgrades are repetitive, low-risk, and high-volume. Devin handles them weekly without human intervention
  - **"Scheduled sessions = always-on maintenance"** — teams set the policy once, and Devin executes it on a cadence
  - **"Agent Command Center for fleet management"** — when running upgrades across many repos, the Kanban board shows which are done, in progress, or need attention
  - **"Scales across repos and tech stacks"** — the same pattern works for Gradle, npm, pip, cargo, etc.

- **Target Outcomes (any of these count):**
  - Devin scheduled session configured for weekly dependency upgrades
  - PR with dependency upgrades and `DEPENDENCY_UPDATES.md`
  - Knowledge item capturing the team's dependency upgrade policy
  - Same schedule replicated across multiple repos/tech stacks

### Lab C2 — Database Schema Evolution

- **Module:** [Database Schema Evolution](../../modules/application-development/database-schema-evolution.md)
- **Repositories:**
  - [uc-spring-boot-upgrade-microservice-extraction](https://github.com/Cognition-Partner-Workshops/uc-spring-boot-upgrade-microservice-extraction) — Spring Boot with Flyway migrations and SQLite
  - [ts-java-angular-jhipster](https://github.com/Cognition-Partner-Workshops/ts-java-angular-jhipster) — JHipster app with Liquibase (alternative)
- **Objective:** Evolve a database schema safely — add new tables, modify existing columns, migrate data, and ensure backward compatibility with the application layer

#### Step 1: Delegate to Devin Cloud from Desktop

**Option A — Flyway Migrations (Spring Boot):**
```
Evolve the database schema of uc-spring-boot-upgrade-microservice-extraction to support article tags as a first-class entity. Currently tags are stored as strings in the articles table. Create Flyway migration scripts that: (1) Create a new `tags` table with id and name columns, (2) Create a junction table `article_tags` for the many-to-many relationship, (3) Migrate existing tag data from the articles table to the new structure, (4) Update the MyBatis mappers and Java domain model to use the new schema. Ensure existing tests still pass and write new tests for the tag CRUD operations.
```

**Option B — Liquibase Changesets (JHipster):**
```
Add a "transaction categories" feature to ts-java-angular-jhipster. Create Liquibase changesets that: (1) Add a `category` table with id, name, color, icon, and user_id, (2) Add a category_id foreign key to the operation table, (3) Create seed data with default categories (Income, Groceries, Transport, Entertainment). Update the JPA entities, Spring Data repositories, and REST controllers to support CRUD on categories and category assignment to operations.
```

#### Step 2: Research locally while Cloud migrates

While Cloud works on the migration, use **Cascade or Devin Local** to explore:
- *"What's the current database schema? What tables and relationships exist?"*
- *"What's the safest way to add a foreign key to an existing table with data — should we use a nullable FK first?"*
- *"What are the best practices for data migration scripts — how do we handle failures and rollbacks?"*

#### Step 3 (Optional): Read the DeepWiki

Open the repo's **DeepWiki** page. Try:
- Have Devin add a **rollback migration** that reverses the schema change
- Ask Devin to add **database-level constraints** (CHECK, UNIQUE, NOT NULL) with appropriate handling
- Try having Devin create a **schema documentation** file showing the current ERD

#### Step 4 (Optional): Review PR with one-click checkout

Focus on **migration safety**:
- **Ordering:** Are migrations numbered correctly and idempotent?
- **Data preservation:** Does the data migration handle edge cases (null tags, duplicate tags)?
- **Backward compatibility:** Would the old application code still work during the migration window?

**Leave a feedback comment:**
- *"What happens if the migration fails halfway through? Add transaction boundaries."*
- *"The data migration should handle articles with no tags — verify with a test"*
- *"Add an index on the junction table for query performance"*

- **Key Takeaways:**
  - **"Schema changes require migrations, not DDL"** — Devin creates proper versioned migration scripts, not ad-hoc SQL
  - **"Data migration is part of schema evolution"** — restructuring a column means migrating existing data, not just changing the DDL
  - **"Tests verify the full path"** — both the migration script and the application code must work together
  - **"Backward compatibility matters"** — in production, zero-downtime deployments require migrations that work with both old and new application versions

- **Target Outcomes (any of these count):**
  - Versioned migration scripts (Flyway or Liquibase)
  - Data migration handling existing records
  - Updated domain model and repository layer
  - Tests verifying both migration and application behavior
  - PR with migration scripts and updated application code

### Lab C3 — Code Refactoring & Tech Debt

- **Module:** [Code Refactoring & Tech Debt](../../modules/architecture-design/code-refactoring-tech-debt.md)
- **Repositories:**
  - [uc-spring-boot-upgrade-microservice-extraction](https://github.com/Cognition-Partner-Workshops/uc-spring-boot-upgrade-microservice-extraction) — Spring Boot monolith with identifiable tech debt
  - [timesheet-app](https://github.com/Cognition-Partner-Workshops/timesheet-app) — React + Node.js app (alternative)
- **Objective:** Identify and refactor tech debt in an existing codebase — extract methods, improve naming, reduce duplication, and improve testability — while preserving behavior

#### Step 1: Delegate to Devin Cloud from Desktop

**Option A — Spring Boot Refactoring:**
```
Analyze uc-spring-boot-upgrade-microservice-extraction for code quality issues. Focus on the Articles domain: identify long methods, duplicated code, unclear naming, missing error handling, and tight coupling. Refactor the top 5 most impactful issues. For each refactoring: (1) explain what the problem was, (2) describe the refactoring approach, (3) verify existing tests still pass after the change. Document all changes in a `REFACTORING_LOG.md`.
```

**Option B — React/Node.js Refactoring:**
```
Analyze timesheet-app for code quality issues. Focus on: duplicated API call patterns that could use a shared utility, React components that are too large (> 200 lines) that should be split, inconsistent error handling across API routes, and any remaining TODO comments in the code. Refactor the top 5 most impactful issues while keeping all existing behavior intact. Run tests to verify nothing broke. Document changes in a `REFACTORING_LOG.md`.
```

#### Step 2: Explore locally while Cloud refactors

While Cloud works, use **Cascade or Devin Local** in Desktop to explore:
- *"What are the most common code smells in this codebase? Which files have the highest complexity?"*
- *"What refactoring patterns are most applicable — Extract Method, Replace Conditional with Polymorphism, Introduce Parameter Object?"*
- *"Which refactorings are safest to do without comprehensive test coverage?"*

#### Step 3 (Optional): Read the DeepWiki

Open the repo's **DeepWiki** page. Try:
- Have Devin add **tests before refactoring** (characterization tests) to ensure behavior preservation
- Ask Devin to measure **cyclomatic complexity** before and after refactoring
- Try having Devin produce a **dependency graph** showing coupling between modules

#### Step 4 (Optional): Review PR with one-click checkout

Focus on **behavior preservation**:
- **Same behavior:** Do all existing tests still pass?
- **Meaningful improvement:** Does the refactoring make the code genuinely more maintainable?
- **Right scope:** Was each refactoring small enough to be easily reviewed?

**Leave a feedback comment:**
- *"Can you split this into separate commits — one refactoring per commit?"*
- *"This extracted method should be tested independently"*
- *"The naming improvement is good but let's also add a brief doc comment explaining the business logic"*

- **Key Takeaways:**
  - **"Refactoring preserves behavior"** — every change must pass existing tests. No new functionality, just improved structure
  - **"Small, atomic changes"** — each refactoring should be reviewable in isolation. Devin commits them separately
  - **"Tech debt compounds"** — small improvements over time prevent the codebase from becoming unmaintainable
  - **"Documentation captures intent"** — the `REFACTORING_LOG.md` explains *why* each change was made, helping future developers

- **Target Outcomes (any of these count):**
  - 5+ refactorings applied with tests still passing
  - `REFACTORING_LOG.md` documenting each change and rationale
  - Measurable improvement (reduced complexity, fewer duplications)
  - Separate commits for each refactoring (reviewable individually)
  - PR with refactoring evidence and review iterations
