# Workshop: Security & Compliance

## Overview

| | |
|---|---|
| **Focus** | CVE remediation, vulnerability scanning, SAST, shift-left security practices |
| **Duration** | 1-2 hours |
| **Audience** | Security engineers, DevSecOps teams, compliance-focused developers |
| **Key Modules** | [SEC1](../modules/security/SEC1.md), [SEC2](../modules/security/SEC2.md), [SEC3](../modules/security/SEC3.md), [SEC4](../modules/security/SEC4.md), [SEC5](../modules/security/SEC5.md), [SEC6](../modules/security/SEC6.md), [SEC7](../modules/security/SEC7.md) |

## Workshop Narrative

Security remediation is often a backlog item that never gets prioritized. This workshop demonstrates how Devin can scan, remediate, and add automated compliance checks — turning a months-long security backlog into an afternoon of focused work.

## Labs

### Lab 1 — CVE Remediation & Dependency Upgrades

- **Modules:** [SEC1 — Upgrade Dependencies](../modules/security/SEC1.md) + [SEC2 — Remediate Vulnerabilities](../modules/security/SEC2.md)
- **Repository:** [uc-cve-remediation-regulatory-compliance](https://github.com/Cognition-Partner-Workshops/uc-cve-remediation-regulatory-compliance)
- **Objective:** Scan a Spring Boot app for dependency CVEs, remediate the critical findings, and verify the fixes
- **Duration:** 60 min

#### Step 1: Get Started Fast (copy-paste this prompt into Devin)

> Run `./gradlew dependencyCheckAnalyze` on uc-cve-remediation-regulatory-compliance to identify dependency CVEs. Remediate the top 5 most critical findings (CVSS >= 7.0) — start with Spring Boot 2.6.3, SnakeYAML 1.29, and sqlite-jdbc 3.36.0.3. Re-run the scan to verify the fixes. Create a `SECURITY_REMEDIATION.md` documenting the before/after results. Open a PR.

#### Step 2: Level Up with AskDevin

- *"What are the known CVEs in the dependencies? Which ones are CRITICAL severity?"*
- *"What's the safest upgrade path for Spring Boot 2.6.3 — go to 2.7.x first or jump to 3.x?"*

#### Step 3: Explore with DeepWiki

Open the repo's DeepWiki page. Try adding SBOM generation, GitHub Actions security scanning, SonarQube integration, or pre-commit hooks for secrets detection.

#### Step 4: Review the PR and Give Feedback

- Verify the right dependencies were upgraded
- Ask Devin to add a CI workflow that fails on CRITICAL CVEs

**Target Outcomes:** OWASP report with CVEs remediated, SBOM generated, CI gating workflow, remediation documentation

### Lab 2 — Shift-Left Security & SAST

- **Modules:** [SEC3 — Shift Left Security](../modules/security/SEC3.md) + [SEC6 — Event-Driven SAST Remediation](../modules/security/SEC6.md)
- **Repository:** [uc-cve-remediation-regulatory-compliance](https://github.com/Cognition-Partner-Workshops/uc-cve-remediation-regulatory-compliance)
- **Objective:** Add automated security scanning to the CI pipeline and remediate SAST findings
- **Duration:** 45 min

#### Step 1: Get Started Fast (copy-paste this prompt into Devin)

> Add a GitHub Actions workflow to uc-cve-remediation-regulatory-compliance that runs Trivy vulnerability scanning on every PR. The workflow should fail the build if any CRITICAL or HIGH severity CVEs are found. Also add a pre-commit hook configuration for gitleaks secrets detection. Open a PR.

#### Step 2: Level Up with AskDevin

- *"What SAST tools are available for Spring Boot applications? Compare Trivy, Snyk, and OWASP Dependency-Check."*
- *"What pre-commit hooks should a security-focused repo have?"*

#### Step 3: Explore with DeepWiki

Open the repo's DeepWiki page. Try adding SonarQube scanning (the repo has a pre-configured `docker-compose.sonarqube.yml`), or implement secrets scanning with gitleaks.

#### Step 4: Review the PR and Give Feedback

- Verify the CI workflow is correctly configured
- Ask Devin to add severity thresholds or exclusion lists for known false positives

**Target Outcomes:** CI security scanning workflow, pre-commit hooks, SAST integration

## Repos Required

- [ ] uc-cve-remediation-regulatory-compliance

## Key Takeaways

- **"Security backlog → afternoon of work"** — Devin systematically remediates CVEs that would take weeks manually
- **"Shift left"** — automated scanning in CI catches new vulnerabilities before they reach production
- **"Evidence-based compliance"** — SBOM, scan reports, and remediation documentation provide audit trails
