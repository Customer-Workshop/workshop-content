# B1 — Upgrade Dependencies

## Challenge

Upgrade outdated and vulnerable dependencies in a project.

## Options

### Option 1: Node.js Dependencies
- **Repository:** [app_timesheet-client](https://github.com/Cognition-Partner-Workshops/app_timesheet-client)
- **Task:** Resolve this GitHub Issue: https://github.com/Cognition-Partner-Workshops/app_timesheet-client/issues/2

### Option 2: Java/Gradle Dependencies
- **Repository:** [uc-cve-remediation-regulatory-compliance](https://github.com/Cognition-Partner-Workshops/uc-cve-remediation-regulatory-compliance)
- **Task:** Upgrade Spring Boot from 2.6.3 to the latest stable 2.7.x or 3.x, updating all transitive dependencies. Verify the build still passes.
- **Tip:** This repo has OWASP Dependency-Check pre-configured. Run `./gradlew dependencyCheckAnalyze` before and after upgrading to see which CVEs are resolved. For full SAST coverage, see [B2 — Remediate Vulnerabilities](sec-remediate-vulnerabilities.md).

## Sample Prompt

> Audit the dependencies in [repo] for known vulnerabilities. Upgrade all vulnerable dependencies to their latest secure versions. Ensure the build and tests still pass after upgrades. Open a PR with the changes.
