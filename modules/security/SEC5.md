## Challenge

Scan a codebase for hardcoded secrets, credentials, and sensitive data. Implement secrets detection in CI, migrate hardcoded values to environment variables, and add pre-commit hooks to prevent future secret leaks.

## Target Outcomes

- Secrets scan completed (gitleaks, trufflehog, or detect-secrets)
- All hardcoded secrets migrated to environment variables or config files
- Pre-commit hook installed for secrets detection
- CI step added to block PRs that introduce secrets
- PR with remediation and tooling

## What Participants Will Learn

- How Devin identifies hardcoded secrets and credentials in source code
- How to implement secrets detection as a preventive control
- The difference between detection (finding existing secrets) and prevention (blocking new ones)
- Best practices for secrets management in application code

## Devin Features Exercised

- Codebase scanning and pattern recognition
- CI/CD authoring (GitHub Actions, pre-commit hooks)
- Environment variable and configuration management
- PR creation with security tooling

## Difficulty

Intermediate

## Estimated Time

45 minutes

## <a id="app_timesheet"></a>app_timesheet

**Repository:** [app_timesheet](https://github.com/Cognition-Partner-Workshops/app_timesheet)

Node.js application — scan for hardcoded API keys, database credentials, and JWT secrets in the codebase.

### Step 1: Get Started Fast

> Install and run gitleaks on app_timesheet to scan for hardcoded secrets and credentials. Migrate any findings to environment variables using a `.env.example` file (without actual secret values). Add a pre-commit hook using husky that runs gitleaks on staged files. Add a GitHub Actions step that fails PRs introducing new secrets. Open a PR.

### Step 2: Level Up with AskDevin

- *"Are there any hardcoded secrets, API keys, or database connection strings in app_timesheet?"*
- *"What's the current approach to configuration management? Are environment variables used consistently?"*

### Step 3: Explore with DeepWiki

Open the repo's DeepWiki page to understand the configuration and authentication setup. Identify all places where secrets or credentials are referenced.

### Step 4: Review the PR and Give Feedback

- **Review the diff** — are all secrets properly externalized? Is the `.env.example` complete?
- **Leave a comment** asking Devin to also add a `.gitignore` entry for `.env` files if missing

## <a id="uc-cve-remediation-regulatory-compliance"></a>uc-cve-remediation-regulatory-compliance

**Repository:** [uc-cve-remediation-regulatory-compliance](https://github.com/Cognition-Partner-Workshops/uc-cve-remediation-regulatory-compliance)

Spring Boot application — scan for hardcoded database credentials, Spring Security secrets, and application properties with sensitive values.

### Step 1: Get Started Fast

> Install and run gitleaks on uc-cve-remediation-regulatory-compliance to scan the full git history for leaked secrets. Also review `application.properties` and `application.yml` for hardcoded credentials. Migrate all sensitive configuration to environment variable placeholders (e.g., `${DB_PASSWORD}`). Add a GitHub Actions workflow step that runs gitleaks on every PR. Open a PR.

### Step 2: Level Up with AskDevin

- *"What sensitive configuration values are hardcoded in the Spring Boot application properties?"*
- *"Does the git history contain any committed secrets that need to be rotated?"*

### Step 3: Explore with DeepWiki

Open the repo's DeepWiki page to understand the application configuration and database connection setup.

### Step 4: Review the PR and Give Feedback

- **Review the diff** — are Spring Boot property placeholders used correctly for externalized config?
- **Leave a comment** asking Devin to add documentation on how to configure the required environment variables

## <a id="uc-framework-upgrade-monolith-to-microservices"></a>uc-framework-upgrade-monolith-to-microservices

**Repository:** [uc-framework-upgrade-monolith-to-microservices](https://github.com/Cognition-Partner-Workshops/uc-framework-upgrade-monolith-to-microservices)

Spring Boot monolith — scan for secrets in application config, JWT signing keys, and database credentials.

### Step 1: Get Started Fast

> Run gitleaks on uc-framework-upgrade-monolith-to-microservices to detect any hardcoded secrets. Review the application configuration for hardcoded database URLs, JWT secrets, and API keys. Externalize all sensitive values to environment variables. Add a pre-commit hook for secrets detection. Open a PR.

### Step 2: Level Up with AskDevin

- *"What JWT signing mechanism is used? Is the signing key hardcoded or externalized?"*
- *"Are there any test fixtures or seed data files that contain realistic-looking credentials?"*

### Step 3: Explore with DeepWiki

Open the repo's DeepWiki page to understand the authentication and authorization configuration. JWT secrets and database credentials are the primary targets.

### Step 4: Review the PR and Give Feedback

- **Review the diff** — is the JWT secret properly externalized? Are test fixtures using obviously fake credentials?
- **Leave a comment** asking Devin to also add a `.gitleaks.toml` config to tune detection rules for this project
