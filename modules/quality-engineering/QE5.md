## Challenge

Identify and resolve code smells, tech debt, and structural issues in a codebase. This challenge focuses on improving code quality through refactoring — extracting methods, reducing complexity, removing duplication, and improving naming — without changing external behavior.

## Target Outcomes

- Code smells identified and cataloged (complexity, duplication, long methods, etc.)
- Refactoring applied with no behavioral changes
- All existing tests still pass after refactoring
- PR with clear description of each refactoring and its rationale

## What Participants Will Learn

- How Devin identifies code smells and structural issues
- How Devin applies refactoring patterns (Extract Method, Rename, Move, etc.)
- How to verify refactoring safety through existing tests
- The difference between cosmetic cleanup and meaningful structural improvement

## Devin Features Exercised

- Deep codebase analysis
- Multi-file refactoring
- Test verification (ensuring no regressions)
- PR creation with refactoring rationale

## Difficulty

Intermediate

## Estimated Time

45 minutes

## <a id="app_timesheet"></a>app_timesheet

**Repository:** [app_timesheet](https://github.com/Cognition-Partner-Workshops/app_timesheet)

React + Express application with opportunities for backend route handler refactoring and frontend component decomposition.

### Step 1: Get Started Fast

> Analyze app_timesheet for code smells and tech debt. Focus on the backend route handlers and service layer — identify long functions, duplicated logic, and poor naming. Refactor the top 5 most impactful issues without changing any external behavior. Run all existing tests to verify no regressions. Open a PR documenting each refactoring.

### Step 2: Level Up with AskDevin

- *"What are the most complex functions in app_timesheet? Which ones have the highest cyclomatic complexity?"*
- *"Are there any duplicated patterns across the backend route handlers that could be extracted into shared utilities?"*

### Step 3: Explore with DeepWiki

Open the repo's DeepWiki page to understand the architecture. Identify modules with the tightest coupling or most dependencies — these are candidates for structural refactoring.

### Step 4: Review the PR and Give Feedback

- **Review the diff** — does each refactoring preserve behavior? Are the new names more descriptive?
- **Leave a comment** asking Devin to also extract a specific repeated pattern you notice

## <a id="calcom"></a>cal.com

**Repository:** [cal.com](https://github.com/Cognition-Partner-Workshops/cal.com)

Large TypeScript monorepo with many opportunities for component decomposition and utility extraction.

### Step 1: Get Started Fast

> Analyze the cal.com codebase for code smells in the packages/features/ directory. Identify components that are too large (>300 lines), functions with high cyclomatic complexity, and duplicated patterns. Refactor the top 5 most impactful issues. Run tests to verify. Open a PR.

### Step 2: Level Up with AskDevin

- *"Which packages in cal.com have the most code duplication across them?"*
- *"Are there any circular dependencies between packages that should be resolved?"*

### Step 3: Explore with DeepWiki

Open the repo's DeepWiki page to understand the package dependency graph. Target refactoring at the most tangled dependencies.

### Step 4: Review the PR and Give Feedback

- **Review the diff** — are the refactorings scoped appropriately for a large monorepo?
- **Leave a comment** asking Devin to refactor a specific large component you identify

## <a id="ts-java-spring-boot-realworld-example-app"></a>ts-java-spring-boot-realworld-example-app

**Repository:** [ts-java-spring-boot-realworld-example-app](https://github.com/Cognition-Partner-Workshops/ts-java-spring-boot-realworld-example-app)

Spring Boot application with potential for service layer refactoring, DTO pattern improvements, and exception handling cleanup.

### Step 1: Get Started Fast

> Analyze ts-java-spring-boot-realworld-example-app for code smells. Focus on: long service methods, duplicated data mapping logic, inconsistent error handling patterns, and missing separation of concerns. Refactor the top 5 issues. Ensure all tests pass. Open a PR.

### Step 2: Level Up with AskDevin

- *"Are there any God classes or services that handle too many responsibilities?"*
- *"Is the exception handling consistent across all controllers?"*

### Step 3: Explore with DeepWiki

Open the repo's DeepWiki page to understand the layered architecture. Identify where layers are leaking (e.g., database concerns in controllers).

### Step 4: Review the PR and Give Feedback

- **Review the diff** — do the refactorings improve separation of concerns?
- **Leave a comment** asking Devin to extract a specific cross-cutting concern

## <a id="uc-framework-upgrade-monolith-to-microservices"></a>uc-framework-upgrade-monolith-to-microservices

**Repository:** [uc-framework-upgrade-monolith-to-microservices](https://github.com/Cognition-Partner-Workshops/uc-framework-upgrade-monolith-to-microservices)

Spring Boot 2.6.3 monolith with both REST and GraphQL APIs — opportunities for reducing duplication between the two API surfaces.

### Step 1: Get Started Fast

> Analyze uc-framework-upgrade-monolith-to-microservices for code smells. The app has both REST controllers and GraphQL datafetchers serving the same data — identify duplicated logic between them. Also find long methods, inconsistent patterns, and poor naming. Refactor the top 5 issues. Ensure all tests pass. Open a PR.

### Step 2: Level Up with AskDevin

- *"How much logic is duplicated between the REST and GraphQL layers? Could a shared service layer reduce this?"*
- *"Are there any MyBatis mappers that could be simplified or consolidated?"*

### Step 3: Explore with DeepWiki

Open the repo's DeepWiki page to understand the dual API architecture and identify the shared service layer that both APIs should use.

### Step 4: Review the PR and Give Feedback

- **Review the diff** — does the refactoring reduce duplication without breaking either API surface?
- **Leave a comment** asking Devin to verify both REST and GraphQL responses are unchanged
