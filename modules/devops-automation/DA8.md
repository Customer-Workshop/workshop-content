## Challenge

Decompose a bounded context from a monolith into a standalone microservice that conforms to an existing platform engineering standard. The new service must include its own IaC (Helm chart, Dockerfile, ArgoCD manifests, CI/CD pipeline) that follows the patterns defined in the platform-engineering-shared-services repo. This exercises Devin's ability to analyze domain boundaries, extract code, generate infrastructure-as-code, and ensure the result conforms to organizational platform standards.

## Target Outcomes

- One bounded context (Inventory) extracted as a standalone .NET 8 Web API microservice
- Monolith refactored to call the new service via HTTP (replacing in-process calls)
- Dockerfile with multi-stage build following the IaC repo pattern
- Helm chart with deployment, service, network policy, service monitor, and HPA
- ArgoCD application manifests for dev and staging environments
- GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline (build, test, push to ECR, ArgoCD sync)
- All IaC conforming to the platform-engineering-shared-services standard (namespaces, resource quotas, network policies)
- PR in the monolith repo with the refactored code
- PR in app_dotnet-angular-microservices with the new service code and service-level IaC

## What Participants Will Learn

- How Devin analyzes multiple repos to understand platform standards and architectural patterns
- How Devin decomposes a monolith by extracting a bounded context into a standalone service
- How Devin generates production-grade IaC (Helm, ArgoCD, Dockerfile, CI/CD) that conforms to organizational standards
- Service communication patterns (HTTP client replacing in-process calls)
- How to use context repositories to guide Devin's architectural decisions
- The difference between platform-level infrastructure and service-level infrastructure

## Devin Features Exercised

- Multi-repo context awareness (reading platform standard + IaC patterns + monolith source)
- Architectural analysis and domain boundary identification
- Code extraction and refactoring (.NET, Angular)
- Infrastructure-as-code generation (Helm, Dockerfile, ArgoCD, GitHub Actions)
- Unit testing and integration testing
- PR creation and PR comment responses
- DeepWiki for codebase exploration across multiple repos
- AskDevin for pre-session architectural planning

## Difficulty

Advanced

## Estimated Time

75 minutes

## Prerequisites

The following repos must be added to the Devin machine via Settings > Repositories:
- `platform-engineering-shared-services` — the platform standard (EKS, namespaces, network policies, monitoring)
- `app_dotnet-angular-monolith` — the .NET 8 + Angular 17 monolith to decompose
- `app_dotnet-angular-monolith-iac` — the existing IaC patterns (Helm chart, Dockerfile, ArgoCD manifests)
- `app_dotnet-angular-microservices` — landing repo where decomposed services and service-level IaC are pushed

All four repos are in the [Cognition-Partner-Workshops](https://github.com/Cognition-Partner-Workshops) GitHub org.

## Branch Convention

Each participant works on a dedicated branch: **`workshop-<participant>`** (e.g., `workshop-alice`, `workshop-bob`). This prevents conflicts when multiple participants run the lab simultaneously against the same repos.

Include the branch name in your Devin session prompt so that PRs target the correct branch.

## Notes

- This challenge uses .NET 8 and Angular 17 — a different tech stack from the Java/Spring Boot decomposition in [MM3](../migration-modernization/MM3.md)
- The key differentiator is **platform conformance** — the extracted service must follow the patterns in `platform-engineering-shared-services` and `app_dotnet-angular-monolith-iac`
- The Inventory bounded context is recommended as the extraction target because it has clear boundaries and moderate complexity
- All new service code and service-level IaC goes into `app_dotnet-angular-microservices` — no need to create separate repos per service
- Each participant uses their own `workshop-<participant>` branch to avoid conflicts

## <a id="app_dotnet-angular-monolith"></a>app_dotnet-angular-monolith

**Repository:** [app_dotnet-angular-monolith](https://github.com/Cognition-Partner-Workshops/app_dotnet-angular-monolith)

.NET 8 + Angular 17 monolith (OrderManager) with four tightly coupled modules: Orders, Products, Customers, and Inventory. All modules share a single SQLite database via Entity Framework Core. The Inventory module manages stock levels, warehouse locations, and low-stock alerts.

**Context Repositories:**
- [platform-engineering-shared-services](https://github.com/Cognition-Partner-Workshops/platform-engineering-shared-services) — Terraform modules for EKS, Helm values for ArgoCD/Prometheus/Grafana, namespace provisioning with resource quotas and network policies
- [app_dotnet-angular-monolith-iac](https://github.com/Cognition-Partner-Workshops/app_dotnet-angular-monolith-iac) — Helm chart, multi-stage Dockerfile, ArgoCD application manifests, CI/CD pipeline for the monolith

### Step 1: Get Started Fast

> **Decompose the Inventory module from app_dotnet-angular-monolith into a standalone microservice.**
>
> Work on branch `workshop-<participant>` in both repos.
>
> Use these repos as context for platform patterns and IaC standards:
> - `platform-engineering-shared-services` — defines the platform standard (namespaces, network policies, monitoring, ArgoCD)
> - `app_dotnet-angular-monolith-iac` — contains the existing Helm chart, Dockerfile, and ArgoCD patterns to follow
>
> Deliverables:
> 1. **New .NET 8 Web API** for the inventory-service with its own models, controllers, services, and EF Core DbContext
> 2. **Angular 17 frontend components** for inventory management
> 3. **Dockerfile** — multi-stage build following the pattern in `app_dotnet-angular-monolith-iac/docker/Dockerfile`
> 4. **Helm chart** — deployment, service, network policy, service monitor, HPA (follow `app_dotnet-angular-monolith-iac/helm/`)
> 5. **ArgoCD application manifests** for dev and staging (follow `app_dotnet-angular-monolith-iac/argocd/`)
> 6. **GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline** — build, test, push to ECR, trigger ArgoCD sync
> 7. **Monolith refactoring** — replace in-process Inventory calls with an HTTP client that calls the new service
>
> Push the new inventory-service code and all service-level IaC to `app_dotnet-angular-microservices` on branch `workshop-<participant>`. Create a PR.
> Push the monolith refactoring changes to `app_dotnet-angular-monolith` on branch `workshop-<participant>`. Create a PR.
> Build and test both services locally to verify they work together.

### Step 2: Level Up with AskDevin

Use these questions before or during the session to improve results:

- *"Analyze the domain boundaries in app_dotnet-angular-monolith. Which modules are tightly coupled and which have clean boundaries? What shared code exists between the Inventory module and other modules?"*
- *"Look at the Helm chart in app_dotnet-angular-monolith-iac and the namespace provisioning in platform-engineering-shared-services. What Kubernetes resources does a new microservice need to conform to the platform standard?"*
- *"What's the best HTTP client pattern in .NET 8 for service-to-service communication? Should we use IHttpClientFactory with typed clients or Refit?"*

### Step 3: Explore with DeepWiki

Open each repo's DeepWiki page to understand the architecture before starting:

1. **app_dotnet-angular-monolith** — Understand the module structure, shared models, dependency graph between Orders/Products/Customers/Inventory. Identify what code belongs exclusively to Inventory vs. what is shared.
2. **platform-engineering-shared-services** — Understand the namespace provisioning pattern, network policy defaults, and monitoring setup. This defines what the new service must conform to.
3. **app_dotnet-angular-monolith-iac** — Understand the Helm chart structure, Dockerfile build stages, ArgoCD application configuration, and CI/CD pipeline. The new service's IaC should mirror these patterns.

### Step 4: Review the PR and Give Feedback

- **Review the monolith PR** — Does the HTTP client correctly replace all in-process Inventory calls? Is the `InventoryServiceClient` properly registered in DI? Are there any leftover direct references to Inventory models or DbSets?
- **Review the new service** — Does it follow the platform standard? Does the Helm chart include network policies, service monitors, and HPA? Does the ArgoCD manifest target the correct namespace (`decomposition-dev`, `decomposition-staging`)?
- **Leave a comment** asking Devin to improve something specific:
  - *"Add circuit breaker and retry logic to the InventoryServiceClient using Polly"*
  - *"The Helm chart is missing a PodDisruptionBudget — add one with minAvailable: 1"*
  - *"Add integration tests that verify the HTTP communication between the monolith and inventory-service"*
- **Watch Devin respond** to your PR comment and push a fix

### Step 5: Bonus Challenges

If time permits, extend the session with these follow-up prompts:

- *"Extract the Customers module next, following the same pattern you used for Inventory. Add it to app_dotnet-angular-microservices on the same workshop branch with its own Helm chart and ArgoCD manifests."*
- *"Add OpenTelemetry distributed tracing to both the monolith and inventory-service so we can trace requests across the HTTP boundary."*
- *"Create a Grafana dashboard JSON that shows inventory-service request rate, error rate, and p95 latency using the ServiceMonitor metrics."*

**Repository:** [app_dotnet-angular-microservices](https://github.com/Cognition-Partner-Workshops/app_dotnet-angular-microservices)

This is the **landing repository** for all decomposed microservices and their service-level IaC. Each service lives in its own directory with source code, Dockerfile, Helm chart, ArgoCD manifests, and CI/CD pipeline.

**Expected directory structure after decomposition:**
```
app_dotnet-angular-microservices/
├── inventory-service/
│   ├── src/                          ← .NET 8 Web API + Angular frontend

├── customers-service/                ← (bonus challenge)
│   └── ...                           ← Same structure as inventory-service
└── README.md
```

Each participant pushes to their own `workshop-<participant>` branch.
